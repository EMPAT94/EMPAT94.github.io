title: Preparing for PGDM in Canada (Draft 2)
---

This is a rough outline of the steps I took preparing for my journey to Canada for studies. I'm outlining them below to give a sort of holistic view on the whole process for those who intend to do the same. Please do not base you entire plan on this single post; I highly recommend contacting IDP consulting agency. They provide all information for _free_!

> All the information in blocks like this are my personal opinions.

> If you are anywhere in Navi Mumbai, seek out Avani Patel <avani.patel@idp.com> at IDP Vashi. She was instrumental in getting my admission and visa stuff done on time.

## Phase 1: Prepare for Admission

1. First step is to give an IELTS (Comupter-Academic) exam that assesses your english skills.

   - It consists of a reading + writing + speaking trio of tests.

   - It is required to get a score of atleast 6 out of 9 overall.

   - All information regarding ielts can be found on [ielts.org](https://www.ielts.org/) and [ielts.idp.com](https://ielts.idp.com/)

1. Apply to colleges.

   - Checkout colleges and courses in Ontario on [ontariocolleges.ca](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/colleges)

   - Apply to at least 5 colleges.

   > Ideally, you should apply for a 2 years course, so you get a 3 year work permit for it. You can also apply for two 1 year courses for same benefit. Note however that for a single 1 year course, only 1 year work permit is allowed. And you can only get work permit via study _once_.

1. Wait for Admission Approval

   > While you can't take out a loan without an admission letter in hand, I recommend having some funds on hand as colleges usually ask for some amount (mine was 2300$) to book a seat and lets you pay the rest (a year's worth of fees) in coming months.

## Phase 2: Prepare for Visa (Post-Admission)

1. Apply for GIC.

   - GIC is a sort of "guarantee" to the Candian govt that you have money to support yourself here. You pay an upfront 10,000$ (was ~6L Rupees for me) into a Canadian bank in form of a sorta-fixed FD that you get disbursed into your account (that will be opened after you arrive in Canada) every month or so.

   > Most common options for opening GIC is Scotia or CIBC. I opened a CIBC because I had a referral from a friend. I'll be posting the link below for my referral as well.

1. Get VISA Photo & Statement of Purpose ready.

   - VISA photo is _slightly_ different from Passport photo. More closeup. See details here [Visa Photograph Specifications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/temporary-resident-visa-application-photograph-specifications.html)

   - Statement of Purpose has some mandatory requirements (Doublecheck with your agent):

     - College/Course/Dates clearly stated
     - A little Family Background
     - A bit about academics (previous scores and GPA etc)
     - Professional experience, if any
     - Reasoning for why the specific course and why Canada?
     - Some financial background, stating GIC and Fees paid details
     - Some stuff about "what after" course ends. To convince you won't overstay your visa.

1. CDC Medical Checkup

   - To book a medical appointment, you have to email CDC center <info.north@cdcgroup.co.in> with the location you wish to get the checkup done at (and dates, if you have preference). They will reply with a free date/time and you have to confirm the appointment.

   > They might say it takes only a couple hours for checkup, but if I were you I'd block out the whole day for it. There is a _lot_ of crowd.

1. Biometrics registration

   - Basically to store your fingerprints and irises. Can book your appointment here [vfsglobal.ca](https://www.vfsglobal.ca/IRCC-AppointmentWave1/)

   > They might try to sell you a "VIP" treatment at the place. It's not that different than normal. Up to you though.

1. Visa Forms

   - Very important step. You need to create an account and submit your forms for Visa.

   > I am not attaching any link here because I highly recommend doing it with your agent. It's a tedious process and a lot can go wrong here.

1. Wait for Visa Approval

   - You get your submission confirmation within 24 hours.
   - TODO: Add which documents arrive and when

## Phase 3: Prepare for Departure (Post-Visa)

1. Buy a ticket

1. College specific stuff (Visa Proof, Vaccination etc)

1. Buy a sim card

1. Get CAD cash or Forex Card

1. Find a room

1. Get RTO Extract (For those who drive)

1. Update ArriveCAN details (2 days before flight)

1. Shopping and Packing (See for lists below)

## Phase 4: Post Arrival

1. Activate Bank Account

1. Activate SIM Card

1. Get SIN Card

1. College specific stuff (ID Card, Study Permit etc)
