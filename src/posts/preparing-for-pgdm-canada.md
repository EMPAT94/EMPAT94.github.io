title: Preparing for PGDM in Canada (Draft 2)
---

This is a rough outline of the steps I took preparing for my journey to Canada for studies. I'm outlining them below to give a sort of holistic view on the whole process for those who intend to do the same. Please do not base you entire plan on this single post; I highly recommend contacting IDP consulting agency. They provide all information for _free_!

> All the information in blocks like this are my personal opinions.

> If you are anywhere in Navi Mumbai, seek out Avani Patel <avani.patel@idp.com> at IDP Vashi. She was instrumental in getting my admission and visa stuff done on time.

## Phase 1: Prepare for Admission

1. First step is to give an IELTS (Comupter-Academic) exam that assesses your english skills.

   - It consists of a reading + writing + speaking trio of tests.

   - It is required to get a score of atleast 6 out of 9 overall.

   - All information regarding ielts can be found on [ielts.org](https://www.ielts.org/) and [ielts.idp.com](https://ielts.idp.com/)

1. Apply to colleges.

   - Checkout colleges and courses in Ontario on [ontariocolleges.ca](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/colleges)

   - Apply to at least 5 colleges.

   > Ideally, you should apply for a 2 years course, so you get a 3 year work permit for it. You can also apply for two 1 year courses for same benefit. Note however that for a single 1 year course, only 1 year work permit is allowed. And you can only get work permit via study _once_.

1. Wait for Admission Approval

   > While you can't take out a loan without an admission letter in hand, I recommend having some funds on hand as colleges usually ask for some amount (mine was 2300$) to book a seat and lets you pay the rest (a year's worth of fees) in coming months.

## Phase 2: Prepare for Visa (Post-Admission)

1. Apply for GIC.

   - GIC is a sort of "guarantee" to the Candian govt that you have money to support yourself here. You pay an upfront 10,000$ (was ~6L Rupees for me) into a Canadian bank in form of a sorta-fixed FD that you get disbursed into your account (that will be opened after you arrive in Canada) every month or so.

   > Most common options for opening GIC is Scotia or CIBC. I opened a CIBC because I had a referral from a friend. I'll be posting the link below for my referral as well. [TODO: GIC referral link here]()

1. Get VISA Photo & Statement of Purpose ready.

   - VISA photo is _slightly_ different from Passport photo. More closeup. See details here [Visa Photograph Specifications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/temporary-resident-visa-application-photograph-specifications.html)

   - Statement of Purpose has some mandatory requirements (Doublecheck with your agent):

     - College/Course/Dates clearly stated
     - A little Family Background
     - A bit about academics (previous scores and GPA etc)
     - Professional experience, if any
     - Reasoning for why the specific course and why Canada?
     - Some financial background, stating GIC and Fees paid details
     - Some stuff about "what after" course ends. To convince you won't overstay your visa.

1. CDC Medical Checkup

   - To book a medical appointment, you have to email CDC center <info.north@cdcgroup.co.in> with the location you wish to get the checkup done at (and dates, if you have preference). They will reply with a free date/time and you have to confirm the appointment.

   > They might say it takes only a couple hours for checkup, but if I were you I'd block out the whole day for it. There is a _lot_ of crowd.

1. Biometrics registration

   - Basically to store your fingerprints and irises. Can book your appointment here [vfsglobal.ca](https://www.vfsglobal.ca/IRCC-AppointmentWave1/)

   > They might try to sell you a "VIP" treatment at the place. It's not that different than normal. Up to you though.

1. Visa Forms

   - Very important step. You need to create an account on IRCC and submit your forms for Visa/Permit application.

   > I am not attaching any link here because I highly recommend doing it with your agent. It's a tedious process and a lot can go wrong here.

1. Wait for Visa Approval

   - You get your submission confirmation within 24 hours.
   - TODO: Add which documents arrive and when

## Phase 3: Prepare for Departure (Post-Visa)

1. Buy a ticket

   > Most wait for their visa to arrive before booking a ticket. Fair enough, but the problem with that is the prices skyrocket by then. If possible, try to book a "refundable" ticket well in advance. I paid around 60k Rupees for a single-layover ticket when I booked it 4 months earlier (Granted, I had my passport stamped by then), but a friend of mine book only a month later for twice the amount. And another friend book it 2 months before departure for over 1.5L. You get the picture.

1. College specific stuff (Visa Proof, Vaccination Proof etc)

   > Hopefully, covid won't still be a thing when you're reading this.

1. Buy a sim card

   > Majority of people buy their SIM after coming to Canada. I got mine while still in India. I did not need to pay anything upfront, simply fill their forms and upload some docs. The sim arrived at home a week later. The advantage of this is that you get immediate internet/telephone access after you arrive in Canada. The last link in the point below is where I registered. I was helped with the process by Priyanka, her business number: <>.

     - [Fido.ca](https://www.fido.ca/)
     - [TODO: Wireless DNA registration link]()

   - The SIM that I currently have, FIDO, also has referral bonuses where both who refers and the one who is referred get one month free of cost irrespective of plans. This is my referral link: [TODO: Fido Referral Link]()

1. Get CAD cash or Forex Card

   - This is only for emergencies. If you have your room booked and travel arrangements made, then you won't really need any of it.

   > I brought around 500$ in cash with me, most of which I deposited back in bank after opening my account. You can bring up to 10,000$ dollars cash, beyond which you need to submit declaration at customs and what-have-yous.

1. Find a room

   - I found my room through a whatsapp group. I recommend joining similar groups on facebook and instagram as well.
   - Beyond social media, you can rent a place from [kijiji.ca](https://www.kijiji.ca) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/)

   > Try not to get pressured into a long-term lease, if you must move elsewhere after a few months for any reason. Also, ensure to have a video-call to check the property first. There may be some token amount for booking, but do not pay it before verifiying everything.

1. Get RTO Extract (For those who have a driving licence)

   - Just submit a letter to an RTO where you got your licence and they will give you a printout of your extract.

   - You can use this extract to expidite you Canadian driving licence process.

1. Update ArriveCAN details (2 days before flight)

1. Shopping and Packing

   - [Personal Packing List](https://nextcloud.priteshtupe.com/s/8wMDfK3HapNjxZs)

## Phase 4: Post Arrival

1. Activate Bank Account

1. Activate SIM Card

1. Get SIN Card

1. College specific stuff (ID Card, Study Permit etc)
