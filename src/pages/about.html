  <h2>My story</h2>

  <p>The day I was born, the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name...</p>

  <p class="font-bold">Wait, wrong story!</p>

  <p>
    While <span class="italic">my</span> birth was not heralded by ancient
    powers-that-be, I personally consider it a life-changing event nonetheless.
  </p>

  <p class="">
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">It was the year 1994,</span>
    when I was christened "Pritesh" by the family. I grew up in a small town
    during the formative years of my life devoted to video games - my "first"
    love. At my mom's insistence, I got a library card - and fell in love a
    second time; this time with words. Well, it was more pictures than words
    initially (looking at you Phantom & Mandrake), but before long I was
    gobbling up Jeffrey Archer's and Dan Brown's masterpieces. Finally, my
    friends dragged me to a new swimming pool club that had recently opened
    where I formed my final love of childhood days - swimming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">In the year 2010,</span> I
    moved to the city for higher studies. Here, I got my first taste of things
    that would define my life for the coming decade - Anime, Light Novels, and
    Programming! (Of course, excluding the usual "firsts" of college days.)
    While the former two were quite understandable, I won't lie about
    programming - I was downright flummoxed by it at first. Only at first
    though. As I learned more about the ins and outs of it, I was understanding
    a problem - dissecting it just so, then wrestling to fit it into a paradigm,
    finally getting to a solution with no more errors. And boy oh boy, when
    things work just the way you wanted them? I
    <span class="italic">still</span> feel that exhilaration of a smoothly
    executed code-run just as much as I did back when I printed my first ever
    "Hello, World!"
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">The year 2016,</span> fresh
    out of college, I was hired by a multinational IT consulting firm through a
    hackathon. There I worked in Innovations across varied projects for several
    clients and even dabbled in some social experiments. Later on, I joined an
    IoT startup as a back-end Nodejs developer, swiftly moving on to front-end
    React development as well. Eventually, I found my way into React-Native
    platform, and thus my professional moniker: Full Stack Web and Mobile App
    Developer, which succinctly covers the core of what I do even today.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">That was back in 2021.</span>
    Going through a couple of years of pandemic brought forth old dreams of me
    to wonder what was holding me back. I realized I had gotten comfortable in
    my spot. And thus, after a tumultuous year of ups and downs, I managed to
    leave for Canada in the fall of 2022. I decided to formally start learning
    Mobile App Development, so got enrolled at Fanshawe for a degree in the
    same.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg"
      >I graduated at the beginning of 2024.</span
    >
    The previous couple years were spent enjoying a laid back college experience
    once more. I made some of my closest friends here, had another set of ups
    and downs as you do, and learned more about myself and my place in this
    world. Thence emerged my current new passions: Diving and Camping. I became
    a certified open water diver, and started taking every opportunity I could
    to dive into the depths. Same for camping, although I only ever did single
    night campings.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work as a freelancer
    with some of the best teams in the industry ever since I landed in Canada.
    With the freedom of both time and finance, I planned the biggest journey of
    my life so far - a trans-Canada coast-to-coast road trip, for summer of
    2024. And here I am, on the road, experincing all that life has to offer.
    Check out the <a href="/travels">traces</a> I've left so far and the
    (self-proclaimed) best <a href="/photos">photos</a> on the internet. I've
    never been more content.
