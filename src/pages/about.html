      also dabble in PETAL stack on the side. With 5+ years of industry
      experience across various projects, teams, and environments, I constantly
      seek to better myself and my work.

  <h2>My story</h2>

  <p>The day I was born, the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name...</p>

  <p class="font-bold">Wait, wrong story!</p>

  <p>
    While <span class="italic">my</span> birth was not heralded by ancient
    powers-that-be, I personally consider it a life-changing event nonetheless.
  </p>

  <p class="">
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">It was the year 1994,</span>
    when I was christened "Pritesh" by the family. I grew up in a small town
    during the formative years of my life devoted to video games - my "first"
    love. I have been gaming for as far back as I can remember. On my mother's
    insistence, I got a library card - and fell in love a second time. This time
    with words. Well, it was more pictures than words initially (looking at you
    Phantom & Mandrake), but before long I was gobbling up Jeffrey Archer's and
    Dan Brown's masterpieces. Finally, my friends dragged me to a new swimming
    pool club that had recently opened where I formed my final love of childhood
    days - swimming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">In the year 2010,</span> I
    moved to the city for higher studies. Here, I got my first taste of things
    that would define my life for the coming decade - Anime, Light Novels, and
    Programming! (Of course, excluding the usual "firsts" of college days.)
    While the former two were quite understandable, I won't lie about
    programming - I was downright flummoxed by it at first. Only at first
    though. As I learned more about the inner workings and outer effects, I was
    quickly attached to tinkering around with the code. The process of
    understanding a problem - dissecting it just so, then wrestling to fit it
    into a paradigm, finally getting to a solution with no more errors. And boy
    oh boy, when things work just the way you wanted them? I
    <span class="italic">still</span> feel that exhilaration of a smoothly
    executed code-run just as much as I did back when I printed my first ever
    "Hello, World!"
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">The year 2016,</span> fresh
    out of college. Got a job at TCS multinational company through a hackathon.
    There I worked in Innovations across varied (and often large-scale)
    projects. Later on, I joined an IoT startup, HPS Lab Designs. I started as a
    back-end Nodejs developer, swiftly moving on to front-end React development
    as well. Eventually, I found my way into React-Native platform, and thus my
    professional moniker: Full Stack Web and Mobile App Developer, which
    succinctly covers the core of what I do.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="uppercase font-semibold prose-lg">That was back in 2021.</span>
    Going through a couple of years of pandemic brought forth old dreams of
    living abroad. Not to mention my friends had already migrated away, leaving
    me to wonder what was holding me back. I realized I had gotten comfortable
    in my spot. And thus, after a tumultuous year of ups and downs, I managed to
    leave for Canada in the fall of 2022. I decided to formally start learning
    Mobile App Development, so got enrolled at Fanshawe for a degree in the
    same.
