      <strong> A programmer trapped inside a simulation. </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      He and a band of misfits selected as "test subjects" must successfully
      complete the "test run" to be able to return to their world or die trying.
      Follow along on his journey where he matches his wits against the creators
      and their eerily familiar creations in a vast fantastical world, seeking a
      way back home.
