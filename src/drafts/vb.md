# Vladimir Bloodsworn Alpha Draft

> Don't try to split into chapters initially (or at all)

## Sorta Timeline

Be Prologue? Vlad aged 12 [Anya 6]

1. Middle of nowhere, Heavenly Sect A and Demonic Sect B have a skirmish that orphans Vlady and Anya. Explore the sibling's "sense". And how Anya is stronger than Vlady.

2. Both head towards Capital city Y as refuges. Spies trying to take over the city.

3. Heavenly sect A succeeds but sect B seeks revenge and go on a killing spree. Sect B Elder/Some artifact etc confront Vlady and Anya, Sect A elder comes to the "rescue"; Vlady goes over to Sect B and Anya goes to A. Anya thinks maybe Vlady died?

For Beginnings

1. Vlady fitting into Sect B; Go over sect organizations, or lack thereof. Something like the dark sides one-v-one, on a sect scale?

2. Mentor explains Ascention progression (how many?). Go over next ascention.

3. Introduce friend(s?). Explore Demonic side relationships. Innocent -> Betrayal?

4. Anya meets at -1 level; Demonic sects progress faster at a cost. Anya/Vlad confrontation #1. She begs him to return, he's set on the route (because of something that he does to protect her? but she doesn't know.)

In Middle

1. War heating up. Explore political arrangement of sects and kindgoms.

2. Consider war-missions and how Vlady ties them in with ascention.

3. Vlad meets Anna(?). Maybe a romantic spin? Couple of missions on how they trick Heavenly sects and progress faster.

4. Vlady goes undercover into sister's sect.

Towards the End Year

1. End of Bloodsworn sect. Vlad is the last Bloodsworn.

1. Vlad gets acquinted with neice?

1. War ends with Vlady; or he ends the war. Anya sacrifice?

1. Big showdown? Best if he uses both sects to reach Final Stage.

Should focus on Anya sometime? Maybe interludes?

Sect B = Bloodsworn sect
