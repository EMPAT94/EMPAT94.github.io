Anudin was going over an old tattered parchment with a furrowed brow. Krach was standing by the side similarly pensive, wondering if he should speak or not. Finally, he gave in to his burning curiosity and asked,"My lord, what are you thinking?". Anudin looked up surprised, as if he didn't know that his attendant was present, but answered calmly nonetheless - "The scroll speaks of the Blood Dragon coming in from the eastern sea with ships in tow; however, during that war, the landmass wasn't scattered into pieces as it is today. I wasn't part of the war, so I cannot attest to the validity of these records, yet I would be hard-pressed to imagine an elf master making up something like this in a historical account. So, my dear attendant, I was thinking that there might be another landmass that I am unaware of - one that has no mortals on it at least". 



Kranch looked shocked for a moment, then burst out, "No offence my lord, but how can you be unconcerned about the incoming crisis? The drakekin from all the outer circles have gathered here, your brother's minions have already surrounded the boy while our assassin takes its time loitering about, and for all that, you seem to be paying heed to some lost legend while the world is on the edge of destruction"; he huffed, then closed his mouth tightly as if he spoke more than he wished to.



Anudin was staring as his attendant with a slightly amused look, eventually returning to the document and speaking once more; "Awfully bold today, aren't we? Seems your brazen attitude runs in the family. In any case, to answer your question, yes - I am quite concerned about the crisis. That being said, I have already played my cards. The drakekin are of no concern as of yet, they will harm us only if their lords decree so. About the boy, well, my brother's minions are actually waiting for our assassin to come, so they won't be acting as well. There is still some time before it - nay, 'she', locates the boy. This is what the mortals would refer to as the 'calm before the storm'. Either way, being concerned is one thing, needless worry is another. Since I seems to have some time on my hands, I wanted to go through the old records to see if I could find anything of significance that might aid us. My brother can be horrifying negligent of the minor details, a weakness we can take advantage of. This unknown landmass theory actually piques my interest quite a bit; in fact, thinking about it now, would it not be possible that the fleet came from another portal - another world, just like the drakekin did? Yes, that actually sounds more plausible. Hmmm...". Anudin once more had a furrowed brow, his mind grinding out possibilities and sifting opportunities.

Niyensi was lazing on her bed, feeling slightly hungry; yet she didn't pounce on the human in front of her like she normally did back in the cities. She had also taken to distinguishing humans by gender, and was currently engrossed in listening to the female's complains. While it was mostly a string of unrelated anecdotes with random life events fitted in, Niyensi managed to gather certain gems of specific information.



Apparently, the western continent was the largest. In terms of surface area alone, if the entire known landmass was divided into pieces, the western continent would have 3/5th, northern continent where she started her journey would be 1/5th and so would the southern continent. The prosperity of people seem to be divided in similar fashion. Most of the population of humans lived on this western continent, with higher technological access and better standard of life. Whilst there was some habitation on northern continent too, it wasn't much developed. Southern continent had no permanent citizens and it seems only certain research teams went there now and then. Also, the western continent was more wide than tall, and the tropical weather it received was generally spread across the continent, although it had many geographically distinct areas.



The female human in front of her was born in a village in the north; and after much hardships had managed to get a job on this ship. Her aim was to find a good husband and settle on the western continent. The same female was currently bemoaning the lack of decent prospective males. Niyensi couldn't relate and was getting distracted by her own thoughts when the female human made a proposal - "Miss, ya know? If ye don't mind me asking that is, is there anyone waiting for ye at the port?". Niyensi thought about it for a bit, correctly guessing that the human was talking in the context of mates, and made a inconclusive remark, "Something like that" and smiled. The female blushed a bit and murmured 'course' for some reason; before she could continue with her charade though, Niyensi spoke "Excuse me, but may I ask for more meat for my next meal?". The human replied "Of course" again, this time much clearer and decided it was time for her to leave. Thinking back on it, there __was__ someone waiting for her, he just didn't know it.



The mage blooded human male. Niyensi now know that there were no "mages" among humans; they had no magic as a species. The great progress that they had achieved was thanks to a "science" that she thought of as similar to alchemy. So the mark was indeed unique. How did a species with no inherent magic to speak of managed to birth a mage strong enough to warrant the hell-lords' attention? Maybe the magic was borrowed? Hmmm if humans never had any magic, how could they borrow it? Maybe it wasn't the humans? The only others she knew who knew was Anudin. Suddenly, something clicked inside her mind - the hell lords, of course. Anudin had informed her of his brothers schemes. Wait so... does that mean the human had essence of her commander and her enemy's commander? The hell lords had already voided the major part of the deal, sending her up was but a side show compared to that. Anudin's information was unexpectedly helpful, and she knew he must have told her all that hoping she would figure it out. 





"Alright, so now I know what's at stake", she proclaimed to no one in particular, "Power, power of the strongest beings to have graced the surface of this miserable planet". She was well acquainted with greed and the consequences it wrought, yet she couldn't help but think of what she could do if that much power was in her hands. Opening a portal back home would be child's play. She could go home, then rally her people to free the prisoners from realms of hell. Ah, the dream. A deep breath and a mental shake of head later, she was back in reality. The power was too dangerous for her to handle alone. She would need allies. In any case, the question of whether to kill the human could no longer be postponed. She was more than half way through her nautical journey. She may or may not have any respite to plan after landing. The minions would be lying in wait for her. Pondering such matters, Niyensi
