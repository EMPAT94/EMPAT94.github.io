I woke up to an unfamiliar sight - lush green grass surrounding me all sides. I closed my eyes again. Weird dream, I thought. I heard some noises nearby, people talking in languages that sounded strangely familiar. Well, dreams gotta end, so I again opened my eyes after some time hoping to see my usual half-cleaned room. The grass was still there. The voices were still there. 'Man, what the hell is going on?' I thought as I sat up in a strange white fluffy bed in an unfamiliar meadow.

Getting out of bed, I looked at my clothes - thankfully, I wasn't naked. 'Why would I be naked?' I grumbled to myself. The moment my legs touched the ground, the bed vanished. Literally. No poof sound effects, no light show, just gone, as if it never was. While I was staring aghast at where the bed was, I noticed that the voices had stopped, I looked over and saw some people who looked to be around my age, they were staring at me. "Hello" I quipped with a slight smile and went over to them  whilst looking around. So the meadow was apparent a very small patch of land on top of what looked like a mountain top, because the ground tapered off at the edges and was surrounded by sheer cliffs on all sides. 'Why take so much effort to bring a bed up here?' 'Hmm, I was brought here as well' 'How?' 'Wait, WHY?' thinking of random questions, I eventually reached the group. I was still half asleep at the time, the gravity of the mess I was in hadn't quite sunk in.
