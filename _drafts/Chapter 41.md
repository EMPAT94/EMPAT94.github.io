## Chapter 41

The Class Evolution window brought back the "screw-all-mages" attitude of the creators back to the fore. I was given an option called "Spell-Maker" with the abilities to, well, make new spells. That's all. No hand-holding, no references, no debugging, nothing else. Atleast, nothing I couldn't do already. And so I chose the only other option I had - Battle-Mage.

Not that I regreted it.

There were three major improvements that I felt immediatly. First, my spells were cantrips no more. Merely brute forcing the amount of mana I could assign to a spell turned what was earlier a static tingle into a current that could shock a monster's bones off. I had only called two functions so far, but I was down from over 4000 mana to high 900s. I was pretty sure I was being extremely inefficient with how I was using it, but I still couldn't believe the devastating power I now held. The "high" level of volume that I needed for magic blacklash protection on my robe's Circle and I couldn't produce earlier was now a "default" setting. The only downside of this was that now my mana was being gobbled uppretty much instantly.

Second, a more subtle improvement from an outsider's perspective, came to my perseption. While earlier I needed to target something physical, and either solid or liquid, to latch a spell on to, now I didn't need _anything_. I could litereally target any point in space and attach my spell to it. I tried this out when I used my Stupefy. I selected a big rock as a target of low potential and the space in front of my hands as that of high potential. Then I immediatly insulated both so their charges could build up without external influence, similar to the trick for lumos. Then after feeding as much mana as possible into the spell, I created channels between the space and rock that behaved almost like super-conductors. And boom! Now that I was not chained to select a physical target, the applications only limited by my level of creativity.

Finally, the most frustrating of the bunch: I now had access to a few environment variables. But I didn't know which ones. I _knew_ that I had access, somehow. And yet the information was being held back from me for no fair reason, another "screw-you" from the System. With a sigh, I pulled up my Status Window for the nth time:

Among the "minor" improvements was the absolute jump in mana capacity and regeneration. I had over a thousand more mana than I expected and my mana was regenerating faster than my _stamina!_. I wasn't sure I liked this path of glass cannon, but I won't say no to freebies.

I noticed a significant boost to my range as well, about a hundred meters all in all. And now it recognized more magical signatures beyond just Runes - the faint markings of the Dark Bear that I had trouble seeing where popping up incessantly on our way back to camp. I had missed close to a dozen in the earlier count. While I wasn't at the point of "sensing mana" as it were, any significant magical object or creature lit up immediatly.

That included monsters.

When I brought this up to Tyee, he cautioned my not to rely on it too much. Many monsters can hide themselves from magical scrying.

Speaking of Tyee, his weird mood from back then had returned full force. I was torn as to how to bring the matter up again, since I was effectively shut down previous time, and staying silent and hoping it'll pass. I decided to throw a tangent.

"So... you're not married yet I take it?"

That brought his out of his gloom quickly, but failed to amuse as I had hoped. His glum look remained.

"No," he replied, and was about to go back to his brooding. I dearly hoped I had not poked a sore spot.

"Not found a gal yet? What's your type? Shart hooves, fluffy tail, and some such?" I continued poking.

Now he was staring at me, a mildly confused look overtaking his features.

"Uh... no. I..." he stammered, but quickly recovered. "It matters not. I have dedicated my life to my path. Besides, now is hardly the time for anything to be getting married." He muttured at the end.

"Huh?" I wondered why that could be. 'There is a specific season that the Centaurs got married in?' "Why not?"

Tyee stared at me for five whole seconds, then spoke as if speaking to a child who has trouble understanding - "Because of the war."

"Ah... right." To be honest, I had forgotten about it. While the cut-scenes of incoming horde, the firey camp and subsequent attempt on my life were memorable enough, I tended not to dwell much on them. I was stranded in some random side-quest anyway, so I figured my involvement in the Centaur War was apprently done with. 'Heh, Arya would've given me a long lecture about thinking this a game again.'

The thought of Arya brought the memories of my companions, and that quickly led to the memories of my family and friends back at home. The warmth of the campfire did little to offset the cold that had settled in my heart. While I was out and about, numerous distractions called my attention away from these thoughts. But at quiet moments like this, my mind couldn't help but wander back home. A twig broken off of burning log crackled and fell deeper into the smoldering fire.

"Hero," Tyee unexpectedly spoke up in a whisper. I looked up, to see him sitting down awakwardly next to the log on my side. I had never seen him sit down before. I gazed at him, not speaking, giving him time to gather his words.

"Kai is the great Seer." He stared up, nostalgic for some reason. "No matter how many times she puts her ancestors up on the pedestal. In fact, she just might be the greatest Seer to ever be bred amongst the Centaurs."

"Oh..." I replied. I had no context so I decided to simply listen to his abrupt topic.

"And she saw what awaits our people. This war..." his beady eyes now bore into mine, "it will shatter the tribes apart. It has already started. Tribes fight against tribes, while humans goad, loot and kill with impunity. No more glory, just unending greed. No more valor, simple base violence. Diseases already curse our kin, our harvest lesser every season. More of our young warriors have died in the last year _alone_ than ever before."

He took a slow breath, calming himself down. Hiz gaze hadn't left mine thought.

"And the war is just starting. You are a human, a Hero even. A beacon of hope for your species, if not many more. A Master Battle-Mage can rout a hunting band on his own. And I doubt your strenth will stop there."

"Oh..." I repeated, this time with deeper understanding. 'But they won't rope the Heroes into this conflict, will they? We're here to stop the calamity after all!' Even I didn't believe myself. Tyee stared at me, leaving me to figure the rest out for myself. I was at a loss for words for a moment and with his eyes burning into me this didn't feel like the time for lax pondering, so I started monolouging hoping it'd take me somewhere.

"You know, Tyee, the place where I come from? My home?" I started, gazing fondly at the fire dreaming of distant memories. "We have no magic there. I mean, not the literal magic like in this world." I glanced at him, making sure he was understood. I continued after a while, taking his silent as his assent. "But there is a different sort of magic there. Our species started off by bumping rocks together to sharpen them into spearheads now a hundred thousand years later, we taught those very rocks to bring us to the moon." I glanced at him again, hoping he could grasp the sheer wonder of it. I saw his eyes widen a bit. "I was one of the many who worked on such... rocks. They connected our world beyond anyone's wildest thoughts, gave up access to information of a scale never before, opened up countless possibilities to even the most mundane of us that even a century earlier only the very best and most opportune amongst us could scaresly begin to imagine. A million years of violence, after conflicts that would terrify even the hardiest of your warriors, and at the end of it, the most peaceful period in known history. I was born in such an era."

I hadn't planned on going on such a ramble, but words simply sprouted unbidden from my lips. Now I fumbled around to make a point.

"That is all to say, I am first and foremost a man of peace. Or rather, I am _not_ a man of war. I have never even been in a fist-fight before coming to this world, you know? All the while growing up, I was awestruck with wonder of the things that made our civilization what it is, yeah? I'm just another curious guy amongst many. Sure I can get loads of power, but can you imagine _me_ becoming a tyrant with it?"
