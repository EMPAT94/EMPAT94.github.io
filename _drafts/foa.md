## PROLOGUE

A 100 years have passed since the War of Terra. 

A race of unknown origin, called drake-kin by us elves, had attacked the West lands of Rim Se Nu, home of the high elves. The drakekin could be called demons, for so was their outer appearance; thick deep maroon hide covering their huge bodies, talons and fangs that could put a Saber to shame; fast and steady their pace was, and we had hard time protecting ourselves. Long we prayed for help. 

Our prayers were finally answered, when from the turgid seas of the East came many white sailed ships with golden hulls, and the forefront was a ship of such majesty that it could only be of the lead. It had a red dragon on its helm and when it made anchor, a powerful entity stepped out. The Blood Dragon had come. 

Soon, the war shifted Eastward, between the forces of the Dragon and the drakekin. The drakekin won’t go down easily and although both sides suffered many losses, the drakekin seemed to be growing in number. The captain of the Dragon’s forces sensed an active portal, and helped by his mages, managed to close it. 

The last battle, fought between the commander of the drakekin and The Blood Dragon, was legendary. Both immortals, of immense strength and power, sparred for the upper hand. In the end, The Dragon gave the ultimate sacrifice, of his soul and annihilated his body along with that of the commander. 

The captain of The Dragon’s army made a deal with lords of hell, giving them the remains of The Blood Dragon in exchange for imprisoning the drakekin, then gave the remaining enemies an ultimatum - Death or Exile. And so it came to pass that many of the drakekin now roam the tortured lands in the realm of hells. 

We elves are now almost extinct, as are many of the species that once flourished in these waters and lands. Arda is left barren, forever scarred by the war. The last guardian is gone. But Arda will heal, she will endure. And when the time comes for the reckoning, she will be prepared.

Chapter 1



“Kirse qolat isde nashl niniye, lisir asul lisir asul…”



Kelly awoke with a start. He was sweating profusely and his heart rate was jacked. With blurry vision he looked around in the dark; yes, he was in his room and not… there. He felt a calm come over him, as he thought about the dream he just had. But the more he tried to focus, the more of it he lost. Finally, all he remembered was fire… bright fire, spread all over as far as the eyes could perceive. And some strange words that he couldn’t recall. Not much use anyway, as they were not of any language he knew. Still, a chill went up his spine when he thought of them, or what they meant. Somehow, they seemed so important in the dream.


He simply nodded his head; this was the third time this week. These dreams were haunting him since his birthday last week. He wanted to make some connection, but at 2 in the morning, it was just too much. He simply went back to sleep.


***


High up north, on the roof of the world, a polar bear was following an unusual scent. She had been in deep sleep most winter and now had 2 small but hungry stomachs to feed, not to mention her own. Till now, she had no scent of any seal around, and just a while back had stumbled upon this scent. What was it? Thick dark foresty smell, lots of flesh no doubt but her bear senses tingled nonetheless… though she couldn’t just pass on the opportunity for free food, especially now that her kids were so eager.


There, the scent concentrated beneath that thick sheet of ice. No, she couldn’t see beneath it, so she started digging with her front paws. Her children watched from nearby, when suddenly, she squealed as if in pain - lots of pain. Her paws were stuck, getting deeper in ice. The bearlings didn’t understand what was going on, they just squealed for their mother. Their mother was in agony, her paws gone, the ice around covered in her blood. She still couldn’t lift herself off, something was pulling her down, and with one agonizing cry, down she went.


***


“My lord, his powers shall erupt soon. But the boy is ignorant, he’ll succumb.”


“Has it awakened?”


“Yes my lord. Although it was kept under for so long, its strength doesn’t seem to have diminished much; seeing as it just made a big meal of a bear and her young ones. That should keep it for a month or two.”


“Good, keep an eye out, inform me of any developments. I must go now. Much preparation needs to be done.”



Chapter 2



Kelly was not a regular guy one sees around. He was an orphan, and he didn’t know how he got so. His earliest memories were of the matron in the orphanage. When he was grown enough to ask who his parents were or where he came from, he just got one answer ‘you were found on the other side of town.’


When he was in his early teens, he really wanted to know about his parentage, although it was mostly fueled by hatred. How can a parent just leave a young one lying on the roadside in rain? Yes, he had dreams of that sort too… heavy rains, lots of crying, being set down under a bright light. He guessed he was abandoned under a streetlamp while it was raining, but came no closer to knowing why or by whom.


At 16, he left the orphanage. They simply didn’t have the resources to fend for grown boys. With no formal education, no money, no destination, he found himself facing the vast world in its entirety.


For a week or so, he made a home for himself on the roadside bench, wrapping himself in newspapers at night when it got cold. He saw the ‘rich’ kids, going about with grace, no fear nor worry about next meal, next breath. He didn’t hate them; neither was he jealous. He simply wished to know the purpose of him being so. Why would god play such tricks? Such inequality? One evening, having eaten absolutely nothing for last 2 days, he decided he’d had enough of sitting around. He needed food, and although stealing it seemed good idea, he had very poor skills for theft. So, money. Where to get money? He knew there was work outside, there must be some, but had no idea where or how he’d get it.


That’s when fate decided to be kind for time being. An elderly man, passing by Kelly’s bench noticed him and enquired about his home and parents. Upon knowing Kelly had neither, the man took him to his hotel, showed him around and told Kelly, he would be given food, shelter and a salary, should he choose to work as a waiter there. Kelly was overjoyed and he jumped on the opportunity.


***


That was 3 and half years ago. Now, although still a waiter officially, Kelly shuffled between acting as the manager, counter, and sometimes as security. He was much better off. How he wanted to believe that he was happy! Yet his heart yearned for more. Could he be a waiter for his whole life? He was scared by such thoughts and now… these dreams were adding to his already heavy mental burden.


He woke up at 4 - his usual timing, did his daily necessities and went down from his attic room to the main hotel floor where he would start with cleaning the tables and sweeping the floors. If needed, the chef would call him. Then he’d work till midday break, have a light meal, and then back to work. His day ended only when the last customer had left.


Today was one of those blissful days when the crowd was especially less. His mid break was overdue by half hour, but he let it slide. It was mostly due to the fact that an attractive girl was sitting on the table behind the pillar with her girlfriends. Now, Kelly was not those types of guys who would holler and stare at every other chick, but this girl simply caught his whole attention. Her cute slightly hooked nose, milky white complexion, straight dark hair that curled at the edges having been lovingly played with by her fingers. When one of the strands fell across her forehead over her eye, he was barely able to resist himself from going over there and showing the strand its place. How he wished her beautiful face erupted into a smile for him, wondering if ever he would even be able to see her again. Then suddenly she looked at him, locking her almond brown eyes with his dark ones. He thought she smiled a bit, and felt a flush in his stomach. She raised her hand, and then he understood, she wanted the bill. Great!


That night, he kept on thinking about that almond-eyed girl. So beautiful... God must be laughing up his sleeve making such beauty and putting her within his eyesight. He knew, that however nice or good or whatever he maybe, he was just a waiter after all. Damn, how he wished things were different! For the umpteenth time, he thought of it. When, or how, his fortunes would change? He couldn’t bear this much longer. It was just like being stuck on that bench. Nothing to look ahead, nowhere to go back.



Chapter 3



Niyensi was far away from her “sleeping” place when she spotted the ships. She had heard of these human creatures that had overtaken the earth several mils ago; after the time when her fellow drakekin tried to take over hell and war had spilled on the surface and destroying some native species. She had heard something about ‘evolution’ though she couldn’t care less then. She knew she’d be trapped here till the end of days, as the solace of death hadn’t blessed this realm or she’d lose herself to ‘hell-sickness’, a polite way of saying ‘being twisted into non-existence.’ Now she wished she’d learned more about surface, having being hauled up here for one simple purpose-


“Find the marked human, kill it.”


***


It all happened just a century ago. She was trying to find some solace from the ever present hailstorm of the 8th circle’s ever-winter when she caught sight of masts. At first she thought it was a mirage, upon squinting her eyes she could make out the high towers and their snowy white tips. Now she was excited. The word around was that the winter-castle of lord Anudîn was only seen when he wished someone to see it; otherwise, everyone in that circle was exposed naked to the heavy all time winter where the cold was beyond what any mortal could bear. Niyensi considered herself lucky, just for the sake of it, as she’d heard that the 9th circle was the most torturous. Bright red flames of soul scalding nature erupted at the will of its lord and it was hypothetically at the centre of Arda where the stillness itself was worth a note.


Shaking all thoughts, Niyensi decided to make for the castle. Something really big must’ve happened, for she knew of no instance where a drakekin was summoned to Anudîn. Making haste, she came forth. The big white high castle was now clearly visible; she noted how the ambience had suddenly changed. The hailstorm was no longer ear-numbing or blinding, although it could still be seen scourging over the lands. She tried knocking on the big wooden fortified doors; in vain, as the door opened on its own. She walked over the highly reflecting white floor, her toe talons clicking and making an almost rhythmic echo, the sound dying out in the dark corners of the hall. There straight up sat Anudîn on his high winter-throne, his eye piercing all the storms of his will, keeping a watch not only on his circle but also on all other, except the 9th. She went up straight ahead, matching his eye. She had been his subject for more than over 250 mils; And although after death of her commander Slasîs, he had been in direct control of her, she refused to accept him as her master. She was on her own now, although that was a thing she couldn’t enjoy… yet.


Then Anudîn had told her about the birth of the mage-blooded human which was soon to be, and how she’d be smuggled out of hell if she accepted his conditions and killed the human before its power became potent. Although she wondered how a mortal, mage or not, could be a threat to lords of hell, she was more struck on the fact that they were ready to break the deal. That would mean the powerful artifacts would no longer belong to the hell-lords, unless… Anudîn was acting on his own. Still, smuggling a drakekin to surface? She knew something was up, but decided to go with the flow for now. She hated the way Anudîn referred to her kind like cattle, but that was beyond her cure. She knew for sure she’d be slaughtered mercilessly later. Now she had a choice, either that or endure the ever-winter or worse, just get hell-sick. Damn!


Soon after accepting, Niyensi was informed that she’d be kept in deep sleep under thick ice in a place on the roof of Arda such that she’d gradually come up as the ice melted and when the time was just right, she would be awakened…


***


These human ships that were afloat the ice-cold water held no awe in Niyensi’s mind. She’d seen the massive navy of the Blood dragon in its peak. The high elves too had much skill in ship-making. On her plane, her home, there were no ships; as there were no seas as such. Water was a priceless commodity, and her kind had adapted to the harsh environment by developing thick hides. She couldn’t remember much, as she’d been stripped of her earlier memories striving against the hell-storms for so long, yet she remembered the place she called home, before Slasîs had been ordered by their king to capture this puny planet. Puny but enduring, she thought. Water, the reason they had come. There was no need for war, this planet held enough reservoirs to fulfill everyone’s needs; but the greed that caught Slasîs’s heart after seeing the lush green surface and abundant flesh was such that he ordered a full scale attack. The rest was history. For Niyensi, the war was nothing but a wasteful event. She shuddered as she remembered the moment when the portal was collapsed. As if her umbilical cord was broken from her home land. She was an arcane drakekin of her regiment and more or less, had rare magical abilities. She was controlling the flow of energy to the portal, when the captain had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and his mages started firing spells and curses on her. She used a block spell, but that broke her connection with the portal, made it unstable, making such concentrated pockets of energy that, if exploded, they’d consume the whole solar system. Then the mages had stopped firing at her and concentrated on securing the portal, or more like controlling it. The captain was a shadowy character, she thought; why else would he try such a feat? But the portal collapsed on itself, taking half the mages into singularity. She managed to get away in the commotion that followed and left the middle earth for north lands, disguised as a night elf. Oh yes! She remembered that time with a small chuckle. Her magic made it possible for her to blend among sentient species. But she was more of a novice then, was caught soon enough and given the ultimatum. She chose exile; but unlike her comrades she didn’t waste a single cycle in hell. No, she learnt, practiced, experienced… how powerful she felt now!


***


The sailors on the ship couldn’t contain their surprise when they saw a woman hailing them from the tip of the berg. She seemed dazed and tired, so they had just taken her in, and after the doc had checked her, put her on the bed in the quarter master’s cabin. There she was now, fast asleep.


Niyensi was wide awake. Boarding the ship had been a piece of cake. She had changed her form to that of a young female human and acted totally lost and disoriented. No back-story required, she smiled to herself. The ship’s captain assumed she must’ve separated from her expedition and got lost, and was lucky to have been found by them. That was all. How really naïve these humans were. Now all she needed to know was where ‘her’ human was. It can’t hide, that was for sure, though it can run. How long can it run? She thought. But eating up her mind were the stark conflicts that she’ll have to confront soon. Why would Anudîn want the human dead? Why did he so specifically choose her, when he had other resources? Was there any way she could come out of this alive? What was so special about this mage-blooded human?


No, she won’t make haste. Patience was the key. She needed more information. Maybe, the human might turn out more valuable alive than dead. Upon that, the conditions that Anudîn had enforced. First was reasonable enough, no revealing of her true nature to any being on surface. But the rest confused her. Well, she will see soon enough. Now she rested in a cautious sleep.



Chapter 4



The sky bleeding red, grounds roared, rocks consumed whole by ever-greedy lava…


And there was Kelly, standing on a precipice, surrounded by hordes and hordes of utterly frightening creatures below, their hides matching the surroundings.


Then Kelly raised his hands and the scene stood still…


The creatures started to whisper; a powerful whisper of other-worldly magic…


Whispers turned to groans, and then into mad screaming… but not a word was out of place…


Kelly felt the sky split, the land around the creatures was crumbling and falling into darkness.


Chanting, as if a manifest of one, all the creatures were now tuned together…


“Kirse qolat isde nashl niniye, lisir asul lisir asul…”


Bright red flames erupted where the land crumbled, as far as sight could go…


Kelly felt the creatures rejoice, he knew not for what…


Then the land cracked at his feet and he was consumed by the fire…


The alarm beeped loudly! Kelly was dumbstruck… this was much more elaborate than the dreams he had had earlier. Careful not to move his thumping head much, he annoyingly tapped the alarm switch and yawned, thinking to himself… another day in paradise!


***


Niyensi was wandering around in some old town. Her human was still quite far. She was now in form of an old woman, possibly thrown out of home and no-where to go. As she had predicted, no one gave her a second glance. While she sought a place to halt for the night, to scan her inventory and more importantly her options, she thought about how recent events had unfolded.


The ship had had quite a haul and crew was invigorated. The only reason she could stand not crushing and swallowing such a buffet was the fact that Anudîn had forbidden it… another of his conditions. Also contributed to the fact was the still digesting bear in her belly. When they had spotted her, they were half-way through the catch.


Niyensi knew nothing of the gibberish they spoke, she just smiled and nodded; everyone assumed she spoke another foreign language. They had made anchor in some bustling port and just as soon as the ship made berth, she took off and kept on walking in the general direction where her senses were leading her. As the sun went down over the horizon, its rays reflected from the watery surfaces of a swift stream, following which Niyensi had arrived in this town.


Soon she came across what looked like a rundown mansion along the dusty road. She saw few humans venture there, most keeping to the other side of road and whispering. Assuming that the place held certain fear in their minds, she chuckled to herself and ventured in through the large iron gates. Just then she realized there was some old human feverishly saying something to her and shifting its head side by side in a funny way, she also noted the look of fear in its eyes; although all she could respond was smile and nod. The human stopped and looked at her in a weird way, then went running down the road. How funny these human creatures are! She thought to herself.


It was mostly dark now; Niyensi had found a quiet dark place in the basement of the mansion and was just sitting there, thinking…

So, Anudîn wants the human dead… why?

He chose her for the task, let loose a drakekin on surface, totally violating the treaty, putting their existence at risk, all for a human… again, she couldn’t find any reason as such. What in Arad’s green lush forest was so dangerous about this human anyway? And assuming she finished the task, where would that leave her? Anudîn couldn’t be trusted; he’ll as surely kill her as snow will fall in winter. But then, how could she escape? More importantly, where could she escape? She can’t go back to her plane without re-opening the portal she knew not how; hiding on surface would be a sad joke, she’ll get caught eventually. So that left her with only one option for now, stick with the plan, until she could figure out something. Yes, she will find this human and….?


“First things First”, she cajoled herself,” just rest now.” And rest she did.



Chapter 5



Radagast was just about to call it a day and go in to have a lie down, when ol’ Grandda came running down the road with eyes wide. He went down to meet Grandda and saw many of his neighbors doing the same. There was a curious circle of men around Grandda, who was catching his breath. Eventually, he said “I saw with me own eyes, some ol’ witch gone and lyin’ in the dark mansion!”


Within minutes, the men had pitch forks and big sticks in their hands with brave faces masking a fear of the mansion. Radagast was a man of faith, just like his neighbors, and believed the dark mansion was not a place for any man. He went in, got his butcher’s knife and was out with the men marching up the road behind Grandda.


Soon, they stood at the broken gates of the mansion, and he took a burning torch from one of the men and went in. He won’t let some old hag come and destroy their homes by waking the ancient ghosts in the mansion. His anger clouded his fear & common sense as he went in without noticing that only half the men followed him in through the gates.


As they entered the mansion, a silence fell among them. Radagast ordered them all to spread out. He didn’t believe for a moment that there was a witch here, but whoever was, she wasn’t supposed to be here and needed to be thrown out quick. He decided to go down the basement, with a torch in one hand and the knife in other.


As soon as he was in the basement, his eyes fell on an extraordinarily gorgeous woman, lying on the floor with hypnotizing grace. As his eyes slide up from her barely covered long smooth legs up the torso, they met with a dark other-worldly stare. He couldn’t break it; he didn’t want to. The red flecks in the dark pupils were both the most beautiful and terrifying thing he had ever seen. Although he thought he should alert the others, no voice escaped his throat. He wanted to move, but his legs failed him. He was starting to panic, when the woman stood up. She has a strange smile on her face, and she was looking at him in a weirdly dangerous way. He had seen the look before, yes… the death stare of a predator. As she took a step closer, he felt himself shivering. His knife fell from his hands, and it took all his will to hold on to the torch. Another step closer and he could clearly see the red specks in her eyes reflecting the light of his torch. She was a couple of steps away from him when he felt something warm down his trousers; he had pissed himself. She didn’t seem to care as she took another step towards him, and he saw what seemed like a curious look intermixed with the deathly stare.


“Radagast….” She whispered, as if trying to roll the words over her tongue. Then, her smile widened and the torch fell from his hands. Her fangs were the last things he saw before the darkness took him forever.


***


“My lord Anudîn, it just ate a human; in direct violation of your condition. Shall we send our minions to drag it back here or should we just kill it on the surface?”


“No, leave it be.”


“But…”


“That is my wish. Now go, leave me in peace.”


***


“It’s the hellllll…” a voice said.


“But I’m not dead yet” Kelly replied.


“Not yettt…” it retorted with a chuckle.


Kelly didn’t know what to say, so he tried to find where the voice came from. It was dark all around, even below his feet.


“Deathhhh….” the voice said as if in a whisper over the winds, looming close.


Kelly turned back just in time to see a creature that he had seen in his dreams before racing towards him.


“Embraceeee Deathhhh….” Said the voice, seemingly fading away just as the creature jumped on him with talons out and long fangs ready to rip his throat out. Then he woke up.


Kelly thought he had fever. This dream that he had was different from his earlier ones. ‘Embrace Death’? Yeah, Right. He chuckled to himself.


He had stopped getting worked up about these dreams. There were just dreams anyway. He had better things to worry about. As he lay in bed thinking about the things he should worry about, his alarm went off. With a sigh, he woke up and started his new day that was same as all the other days; although he did hope to see the almond eyed girl again. Fool’s hope, he told himself.



Chapter 6



Niyensi didn’t really need much rest; after a short time of lying down, she was up again thinking of the status quo. That was when she heard the humans rush in through the gates. She didn’t expect them but she wasn’t surprised. She simply changed her form to a very beautiful human female and waited.


Soon, she heard footsteps coming down the basement stairs. A human carrying a fire stick and a small flat knife came through. She was disappointed with their tactics; why were they making so much noise unless they wished to alert their prey of their presence? Stupid humans, she thought. As she lay there, she saw the human getting caught in her feminine form. While it was appraising her form, a hunger pang hit her. But she couldn’t eat a human, according to Anudîn’s condition. Well, this one came as if on a platter and she needed food. So damn his condition, what’s the worst he can do?


She stood up, clearly excited to fill her stomach with human meat. As she stepped closer, she saw the human start shivering, and his knife fell from his hand. She knew these humans were sentient and had been curious to know their species more. Now, she had a chance. Another step closer and she could feel strands of silvery threads coming from its head, just as it pissed itself. She caught one thread, curious as to what they entail. Suddenly she was glancing through a mixture of thoughts, memories and emotions. Another thread, another mixture. She became highly curious; within a moment, she had learned so much of this human. She tried their speech, by speaking what she expected other humans called this one. “Radagast…” she whispered, trying to test the words through her mouth. Then another hunger pang hit her, and all the silvery threads from the human were of absolute fear. She smiled wider, and decided to end its misery.


***


The torch had burned down half the mansion to char. As soon as the fire became visible above the basement, the other men had fled the mansion. Niyensi was pretty resistant to the fire, and as a precaution, she had taken on the appearance of Radagast while escaping the mansion like the humans, just in other direction.


When she in the thicket of some trees far off from the mansion and the human town, she slowed her trot and concentrated her senses. Her human was somewhere south of where she was. Her next immediate concern was that of Anudîn. He must know by now that she had eaten a human. What will he do now? Bring her back to hell for punishment? Kill her here itself? Although she was a bit scared of what he might do, she was also exalted as the same time. She felt good, having exercised her freedom for the first time in her long memory. She decided to wait and watch for Anudîn’s move, as she ruminated on the information she had gleaned from Radagast.


Humans were a petty species, she thought in retrospect. They thought themselves at the center of Universe. Radagast himself was so narrow minded that she was surprised how a sentient being could be so stubborn about protecting lies that even common sense could dispel. Then she concentrated on the world in general. So, the lands had split in 3 parts. She remembered during the war that the land was one whole called Terra surrounded by seas on all side. Over the mils though, the land had split. The upper half of the north was covered with an ice sheet all cycle round, where she was placed. The lands intermixed with seas. As one came down, they encountered lush grasslands with sporadic human population. The humans in north were mostly “village-folk”. Radagast had an uncle who had visited the western piece of land and came back with stories of large buildings and “vehicles”, saying they were very advanced humans with good “technology”. He had also brought toys for young Radagast. The region to the south held some fear in Radagast’s mind; Grandda said that is where demons come from; down below.


She sat below a large willow tree, thinking of this new world; waiting for Anudîn’s minions and wondering what her next move should be. Was it foolish to have eaten that human? She could’ve just killed it, and it wouldn’t have broken any of Anudîn’s conditions. Then she thought, if she could kill him, then why couldn’t she eat it? The condition didn’t make any sense to her and she decided she’d present this argument to Anudîn if she lived to see him. Yes, it was maybe foolish to eat the human, a hasty decision. Yet she decided not to regret it now. “Just don’t ye be goin’ round makin’ such hasty decisions in the future” she spoke in Radagast’s speech. “If ye live that is!” she reminded herself.



Chapter 7



Sara had always been a romantic at heart, never caring so much about the status and riches of a person as much as how good a heart the person had. This was partly due to her upbringing; her parents always stressed more on values and character. For all that, she had never really fallen in love in all her 19 years of life. Although she showed that she didn’t care, underneath, she wished there was someone in her life like some of her friends had. Whenever she was haunted by such thoughts, she consoled herself by saying ‘I still have a whole life ahead of me’. Her friends were always trying to pair her up with some guy or the other, like last week, the waiter in that hotel. True, the guy was pretty handsome for a waiter, with innocent dark eyes that seemed to pierce through soul and the roughly cut short hair that somehow looked cute on him, and… ‘Uh, Not again!’ She reminded herself. ‘Stop thinking about that guy already’. She sighed; ‘He did look cute though’, she thought with a chuckle, ‘And the cutlets in those hotel were damn good. Well, I’ve got to have them now; I’ll check if Rose is ready and we’ll go there tonight itself’


Rose had been more than ready, and now Sara was wondering what she should wear. ‘It’s just Rose damn it, wear anything, who cares?’ she mumbled, exasperated, then picked up a short black gown. ‘Too much legs’ and the gown went into the heap of other discarded clothes. She finally decided to go with simple red top and jeans, her decision rushed by Rose who was waiting below and had called twice already. She checked her stuff, said goodbye to her parents, apologized to Rose for taking so much time and was on her way to the hotel in a jiffy.


As soon as she entered the hotel, she immediately noticed two things, one that unexpectedly made her heart flutter and other that made her stomach churn. First off, she saw the guy who got her bill last time still on his shift, and seeing him somehow made her feel flustered, not helped by the fact that Rose whispered “There’s your guy” in her ear. Next moment she saw Schmitt and she felt like slapping Rose right in her smirking face when she continued her whisper with “And there’s mine!” Rose had called her boyfriend to meet in the hotel without telling Sara; which made her upset about the whole situation especially since Schmitt was a complete piece of work. She would never understand what Rose saw in that guy. He always leered at her that made her feel self-conscious and uncomfortable. Now she knew why Rose had been so eager to come.


As they took their seats, Rose went and hugged Schmitt tight. He had the devil’s smile on his face as his eyes diverted to meet Sara’s. After seating Rose, he came to Sara with his arms open. Sara’s quipped “I have to wash my hands” and made off leaving Schmitt fuming. Seeing a washbasin nearby, she went inside what seemed like a hastily built cubicle, just besides the main path. There was a mirror in front, in which she saw her reflection after washing her face and exclaimed “Damn Rose. And damn that stupid Schmitt! Damn! Damn!” Just as she finished those words, she heard a chuckle some distance on her side, “Wow, you say ‘damn’ a lot, don’t you? Everything okay?” It was the waiter guy; he was looking at her with genuine concern. She replied, “Yep, I’ll be fine. There’s just this guy….” She trailed off. “The guy in flashy blue shirt? Yeah, he’s been eyeballing women ever since he came. We’re keeping an eye on him. One sign of trouble and he’s out. If he tries anything, just let me know, and I’ll throw him out myself. Cool?” Sara was genuinely surprised. She replied in a positive and excused herself and came back to her seat. As she sat down, she couldn’t wipe the smile off her face, despite herself. “You okay?” Rose chirped with a glint in her eyes. “Sure, let’s order” Sara said and her eyes searched for the guy who had just brought her back from a disastrously moody night. She saw him standing in a corner looking for potential serves, and as their eyes met, she smiled and beckoned him; he was immediately by their table. “I’ll have 2 cutlets please” Sara said, “They’re the best here.” “Yeah, we are proud of our cutlets, best taste in town!” he replied. Then Rose suddenly jerked up and said “I got to go to the washroom. You coming Sara?” As much as she would’ve liked to go with her, seeing how it left her and Schmitt alone at the table, she declined; she didn’t know why. Rose gave a look and left. Schmitt decided to chip in, “Dude, you didn’t even bring the menu card; Go, Fetch” and sent the waiter guy away. Sara didn’t like the way he talked and she said “Talk nicely Schmitt, what’s your problem?” to which Schmitt replied “What? He’s just a waiter Sara. What does it matter how I talk to him? It’s not like he’s going to do anything.” “It’s not about him retorting, it’s about being nice. Why insult someone just because they are doing a job that you look down on with prejudice? He’s also a human and he also has feelings. So be nice.” “Huh? Why are you talking about him as if he’s your boyfriend?” “He’s not, I’m talking about him as a person.” “Right, as if anyone could even imagine going out with that guy. Ha, good luck with getting a girl dude!” Sara didn’t like this turn in the conversation and spoke, enraged, “He’s a much better guy than you, a thousand times better. And yes, if I ever had to choose a boyfriend, I would always choose a guy like him over a guy like you.” “You would choose him over me? HIM? No fucking way. You’re just saying it, but you don’t mean it. You have to be a man to follow through your word. It’s not your cup of tea, my dear. Girls will always fall for guys like me…good looking, rich, educated, who are properly clothed…” Sara lost it at that moment, her anger exploding inside her like a Volcano, ‘Damn you, you piece of shit, I’ll show you’ she thought to herself. And that was also the instant the waiter guy returned with the menu card, and she exclaimed with fire in her eyes “Hey, would you like to go out with me?”



Chapter 8



Anudîn sat complacent on his throne, staring at the dark reflection of the ceiling on his ice-glass floor. Though his thoughts skimmed over the movements of various creatures within his care and control, his mind was set on something else. An event in past that had sent ripples into the future; the future that was now fast approaching.


He was and has always been dead set against the Deal, yet his vote didn’t count has he wasn’t a hell lord back then. The drakekin do not belong on this plane, simple as that. Why his elder brother decided to go for it was beyond his understanding. Now known as Markerith, his brother had sought control over the inner most circle of hell. And he got his wish, which he brought to fore using the mixed remains of The Blood Dragon and Slasîs to gather and project essence & power of different planes. Ah, the spectacle when he ousted the then Lord! As Markerith conquered the 9th circle, the one which he had before fell into Anudîn lap. And there it has been ever since.


He still remembers seeking out his brother through his mind, right after the debacle with the uprising of drakekin. Markerith was no longer the brother he remembered. He had taken on a fiery visage, everything from his eyes to toes glowed with unnatural heat. ‘Proper Hell Lord’ he had called himself. Anudîn tried to reason with him; the hells didn’t allow the drakekin to find salvation, just like they had now, they will again try to escape, even if they know they won’t survive. It was in their nature. “Brother Markerith, heed my words. Use the essence and open a portal. Let these creatures back onto their home. They do not belong here! Destruction of the mortal world will be the only result of this foolhardy endeavor. The Hells feed on the mortal world. Do not doom us brother. Heed my words!” Markerith had done everything but that. Instead, he chose to jest, “Are you afraid of the creatures, Brother Anudîn? Or have you forgotten that you sit on the Ice Throne by my leave only? Do you not have faith in my plans anymore?” “What more plans, brother? Have you not attained all which you have sought after?” To which Markerith replied “Oh, not yet my dear brother, not yet.” With words and looks that sent chills up Anudîn spine. That was the moment Anudîn decided that he must do something, which was several mils ago. As immortals, their patience was legendary. And so he waited, and waited, until things suddenly started changing in the nether worlds. The magic that was once native to Arda had been sucked out eons ago, yet there was an intangible flow now; somewhere, somehow. Anudîn knew he needed to act, and act fast.


About a century ago, he had learned through his spies that Markerith had smuggled the artifacts on to the surface. Somehow, he had managed to embed the artifact’s combined essence of The Blood Dragon and Drakekin Commander into a mortal soul that would attain power after a lifetime and rebirth. He knew that Markerith would’ve marked the soul, which would journey straight to the fiery pit after the human’s death. Anudîn needed to prevent that, as Hell Lords have absolute control over their dominion and all within. Which meant Markerith would absorb the soul and… Anudîn shuddered to think of the consequences. Is there a limit to greed? If he wouldn’t be stopped in the Hells, and certainly no one on the Surface could stop him, then virtually the entire existence would be at his mercy, unless there was someone more powerful than him, which was very unlikely. Anudîn somehow knew that Markerith’s first move after conquering hells and surface would be to open portals to the Drakekin home land and suck in their essence. Then, the next world, next realm, next plane… He would never stop.


***


Just as he envisioned Markerith conquering known worlds, his new servant Kranch came in with news of the arcane drakekin. She had eaten a human! Kranch seemed unexpectedly upset that it had broken Anudîn’s conditions, so Anudîn had summarily dismissed him. Ah! The Arcane Drakekin. Anudîn always had interest in the ongoing on his subjects, and was particularly amused watching the peculiar activities of this drakekin. It was unlike most others, as if not knowing it was in hell forever. He knew right when it came in his realm that it had rare essence of magic in its veins. It had a mind that remained sharp despite the tumultuous blizzards and scourges. Anudîn acknowledged that it could grow its own energy, another of its arcane ability, and that was what made it so strong in its mind & soul; although he doubted it knew its own strengths. That was one of the reasons he had chosen that particular drakekin. First off, he couldn’t send a mortal as it would break the flow of essence from mortal world to theirs. It was strictly forbidden. But a drakekin? Well, it wasn’t part of this cycle, so there would be no backlash. Next thing was Markerith; Anudîn simply couldn’t sent one of his minions on the Surface since Markerith would eventually, if not right away, gain knowledge of that action. Like Anudîn could see to other 7 circles besides his own, Markerith could see ALL of them. And he probably had spies on Surface too. The reason Anudîn asked the drakekin to kill the mortal was because the arcane essence in the drakekin’s body resonated with that present on the mortal’s soul to an extent, since they belonged to the same plane. Anudîn expected the drakekin to simply absorb or shatter some of that essence so that the soul would be weakened. Finally, he expected the drakekin to act reasonably. He held very high faith in the rationale of its mind, having seen it act so intelligently while under his care. To test his theory, he had put on the conditions. A few necessary, some vague, rest utterly useless. He wanted to see how it behaved under these constraints, and wondered how it would test the waters of its freedom. His lips twitched into a slight smile as the soul of the mortal it had killed flowed into his realm. It had found and broken one of his useless conditions, it was growing just as he had expected. Yet he also wondered, seeing how the soul that wasn’t marked to his realm flowed right here. Did the drakekin’s actions on Surface result in similar effects as that of his minions? This was new. What if it kills the mortal and the soul comes to his realm? What would he do then? Could he contest with the power of a weakened soul against the might of Markerith, the Lord of Hells? Maybe, but then a weakened soul won’t help him open and maintain the portal, which meant the drakekin would be stuck here. White mists formed in the air as a sigh escaped his mouth, can’t have it both ways. He had set the wheel turning. Now the fate of all that was known depended on the path the Drakekin shall take.



Chapter 9



“Should I just tell him it’s off? Or would it be too cruel of me? He’ll think I’m crazy – ‘first you ask me out then you cancel on me!’”


“Whatever?”


“Oh come on R, are you still pissed because I didn’t come with you to the bathroom back in the hotel? I’m sorry okay, just, please… I need your help.”


*taking a deep breath* “Alright fine! Tell me, do you like this guy?”


“Well, I don’t not like him. He looks good and is good… but…”


“But should you have asked him out like that? Just because Schmitt got under your skin? Sarr, you really need to get your temper under control – it’s going to be your undoing one day; I keep telling you this but you won’t listen.”


“I know, I know… Okay, how about this? I’ll go out with him, and after some time, you call me with an SOS and I’ll come back home right away!”


“Oldest ruse in the book. Anyway, I’ll do it – if you promise not to bump me off again like you did today.”


“I promise, now what were you going to say earlier?”


*smiling devilishly* “Let’s put a pin on it. Right now, we need you to look stunning for your faux date”


***


It was entirely Sara’s idea to meet in the park that was midway between the hotel Kelly worked at and her home. From there on, movie, dinner, long walks, everything was on the table since the park was bang in the middle of the town – she had said that logically and partly to irritate Schmitt. But now, she couldn’t much think of anything besides wondering when Rose would bail her out.


She reached the park’s gate a bit late. Once again, she had got lost in her heap of clothes. She blamed Rose for that – there was no need to do all the get-up but Rose has insisted! Well, here she was, all dressed up pretty please for someone she was about to ditch in minutes; someone who hadn’t even dared to show up on time!


Suddenly she saw someone waving at her from inside. Then she saw him. She mentally kicked herself for being stupid enough to imagine him coming here in his waiter attire. Instead, he was wearing a deep blue shirt and a pitch black pant. His hair was short as always but today it shined in the reflected light whose source she couldn’t pin-point. As she got closer she saw his smile – a simple smile that betrayed relief and excitement at the same time. She felt guilty for even thinking of never coming and unknowingly breaking his heart. The closer she got, the weaker her legs seemed. A smile automatically erupted on her lips and she had to will her breath to remain calm.


“Wow, you look so beautiful!” he said with such genuineness that her heart skipped a beat. “I’m glad you came” he continued, and she understood where the relief came from. “That dress suits you perfectly” he said and she made a mental note to hug Rose hard next time she met. “Aren’t you going to say something?” he asked and suddenly she came out of her stupor. Her face seemed to heat up and she quickly replied “I’m sorry, I just… you look good too!” “Thank you” he replied with a confident smile, “now, I don’t mind just standing here staring at each other the whole night, but I guess that’s not how people usually spend their first dates?” Why are his eyes so intense? “Yeah, let’s go somewhere” she replied, trying to avoid his gaze and hiding her shy smile.


He gestured her to walk with him. After several steps, he came to halt in from of a moldy looking bench. “This bench has a special place in my heart” he said. “It represents me at my lowest and darkest period in life, a time where I was stuck in void of psyche” She couldn’t understand a word of it and he seemed to sense that as he uttered, “I know this is not the ideal conversation for a first date but I just… ever since we decided to come to this park, I’ve been debating with myself if I should talk about it or not. But looking at you just now, walking past this place is just not an option. As I said, this bench is special to me and so, I’m sharing this with you” Sara decided to keep quiet and listen, as she felt his words taking a turn towards tragic. As they both sat on the bench, he taking a moment to compose himself and she looked at his face for the first time since they started walking. “I’m an orphan Sara. I’ve lived in an orphanage my whole life. About three years ago, I had to leave. I had to spend the next couple of weeks on this bench itself. I had almost given up. Fortunately, I got a job in the hotel and have been there since. I have very little formal education but I love to read. And whatever life hands me, I try to make the best of it. So yeah, I’m a nobody right now but I like to think that I’m a better nobody than I was when I was crashing here. And that I will be much better nobody in the future. Who knows? Someday, I might become somebody!”


Suddenly Sara understood. He was scared that she may not like him because of his past, because he thought he was a no-one. She gave a warm smile that seemed to ease his anxiety right away. “Kelly, you’re a good guy and that’s enough for me. And you’re not a nobody. You’re –” Suddenly, Sara’s phone started ringing. It was Rose. She cut the call and was about to apologize to Kelly when Rose called again. She picked up the call to Rose hysterically bombarding an emergency. Sara said “Okay” and cut short her rant. Now she looked at Kelly with an apologetic smile. “If your friend is in trouble, you should go” he said, trying to hide his glumness behind a small smile. “No actually, she’s not in trouble. She just…” Sara trailed off. “Oh!” Kelly replied. As much embarrassed Sara felt right now, she was impressed by how quickly Kelly catched on. “Well, I’m glad you decided to stay” he said, this time hiding nothing behind his smile, managing to even show some of his white teeth. “So am I” she said, reflecting his smile.



Chapter 10



Niyensi had a restless time. The dawn brought little solace to ease her bewilderment. She expected to be extinguished by now or in process of accepting torment for life. Yet, here she was sitting idly beneath a tree mingling among the shadows cast by ancient pines that graced this region. She had spent the entire night yesterday snarling at jungle noises that she expected somehow to expose Anudîn’s minions. None had materialized. When she wasn’t hyper aware of her surroundings, she was busy making her case to justify her actions. Anudîn was a rational entity, she knew. But where has my rationale gone? She wondered. Fear and worry was eating her up and sitting idly was adding to the helplessness she felt. She berated herself for acting so stupidly when she promised to be patient. Yet when she thought of her actions, her stomach made a satisfied groan. The human’s brain was especially tasty. There she sat flickering between thoughts and fears never settling down on one for long.


As the shadows shortened, Niyensi finally calmed down and started thinking calmly. If Anudîn wanted to punish her, he would have done so already. It was very unlike him to defer judgement. So, assumption: Anudîn was okay with her breaking his condition. Now, she thought, this was only because she knew it herself that the condition made no sense. Not all of them were so. Inference: Anudîn is testing her. But for what? Maybe that was a part of test too. She felt a little light in her heart. Anudîn may not be her master but he deserved credit where it was due. He was adept at intelligent schemes and playing the long game. Till now she thought she was just another pawn, but now she wondered about the “what ifs” ...


Suddenly the sun was high above her head and she decided it was time to get moving again. She got her bearings, then sensed her marked human’s direction. Still south but moving west-ward. So, this human lived on the West Coast. She’ll have to sail down the ocean that separated the North Lands and Coast. But before, she had to figure out where the port to West was first and where she herself was. She figured, correctly, that she was somewhere in the middle of the top island and towards the eastern coast of same. She needed more information and now she had the means to get whatever she wanted, perhaps with a side of some delicious grey. She wondered if all human brains tasted the same. “I’ll find out soon enough”, she thought merrily to herself. “Ye should get goin’” she rasped and made up her mind to see if there were other spoken tongues more suited to her tongue. With that, off she went southward, subconsciously avoiding the mansion. Changing her garb to that of a travelling merchant, she set on finding the next large settlement where she would “ask” about the long journey that loomed before her.

“My lord, the drakekin seem to be banding together, is it happening in all the circles?”


“Yes, that is so.”


“Oh... What of the drakekin on surface?”


“Not your concern Kranch. Did you bring the chain I asked for?”


“Yes my lord. Although I cannot understand –”


“Do you know what happened to Helio, my last servant and your brother?”


“No my lord.”


“I sent him as a gift to my subjects to do with as they will. He was as inquisitive as you are, and he decided to act against my will on a certain matter. Should I feel you are headed in that direction, you shall face the same fate as him. Am I understood?”


“Yes my lord”


“Yet, on this specific subject, you are meant to understand what is happening. I need to find out how my brother means to maintain the portal he opens if he gets his claws on the boy’s essence. Over the years, he has stopped answering my mind probes so I need to project myself in his realm. I expect you to be my anchor to my circle and hence this chain. If you would, bind it on your hand and then we shall get started.”


“So be it my lord, I shall not fail you.”


“I hope not. Or you’ll be dragged along with me. Let’s get started. The lord of Hells awaits!”



Chapter 11



They were walking along an endless path winding through lush gardens, hand in hand, sun setting on the zenith and a gentle breeze brushing past caressing their skin. He saw her hair rise and fall in a rhythm, and shy smile decorating her blush, all for him. He was happy, he could walk this path forever. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, taking in the timelessness of the moment and at that instant, he realized that she was no longer by his side. Nor was there any path to follow, as his next step would take him down the cliff into a bottomless chasm. The sun had set, but the sky was ablaze; the land was barren and red. A deep hum seemed to emit from underground, and he was scared. He screamed for his beloved but no sound emitted from his throat. He coughed and fire emerged in a huff from his mouth. The deep hum was coming closer to the ground, shaking the land beneath his feet. He called for Sara again, looking all over the red horizon. His voice did emerge this time but it was lost among the cracks that now formed in the land. He was growing frantic with every passing moment, his fear of having lost Sara absolute. Amongst the chaos, a slithery cold voice touched his ear. “Embrace death” it whispered and filled his heart with dread. Just as he was about to shout for Sara again, he heard her scream from somewhere beyond his vision. She was screaming his name. Dear god, where is she? What had he done to her? Suddenly, the cracks started spitting fire, fire that melted the rocks it was held beneath. He knew what was going to happen next – so he ran; towards the nightmarish scream that he somehow felt responsible for causing. The land rushed by in a blur, ash and fire tearing at his face. He felt something hot and moist stream down his cheek - a tear drop.’ “Can’t stop now, must save Sara” he tried to motivate himself. It was overwhelming his senses. The exploding surroundings, the cold whisper of death he knew was present and the screams from the distance that crushed his soul. He looked behind and saw a monster chasing him. This was not unlike the creatures he had seen previously but it has a cunning in its eyes which he did not like. The thing was gaining on him fast and yet his heart yearned to console the sounds from distance. He knew now that he had lost. He looked back one last time to face the creature, which promptly jumped on its prey, claws outstretched. “I’m sorry, Sara” were his last words as darkness took over and his feet lost ground.


***


Kelly awoke with Sara’s name on his lips, and a dried tear streak across his cheek. He could not shake off this dream as he had the others. This was about matters dear to him more than his own self. He still had about half an hour left before his alarm went off, but as much as he tried, sleep would not come. Kelly decided to tell Sara about these dreams. The thought of meeting Sara again tonight brought some calmness in his heart. She was really something, that girl. Maybe she can make sense of these dreams. His thoughts drifted between what he should do today and whether he should buy something for her or not. They had met several times now, and he believed he was in love. A rose would do fine, he told himself, imagining how happy she will be when he surprises her with it.


Today was a special day in the hotel. The boss had called everyone in for a meeting during the lunch break, as he had some very special announcement to make. Kelly asked his co-workers if they knew what it was, and all shook their heads in a negative. So there he was, standing when the boss called his name. Kelly went over and stood by his boss’s side. The boss continued with his speech, “...and here we have Kelly, the guy who was sleeping on a bench not 4 years ago and is now practically running this hotel. We know how hard he works as a waiter, always pleasing his customers. I do not know if he has any formal education, but his accounting skills are better than many educated people I know. He has worked every day to the best of his abilities and never asked for anything more in return that what he was provided. To honor his commitment and skills, and also because there is now a vacancy, I hereby promote Kelly to the post of Manager starting right now!” turning towards Kelly as the crowd cheered, he whispered, “My heartiest congratulations to you, my dear boy” and hugged Kelly lightly. Kelly tried, and failed, to hide his tears of joy. He saw happiness aglow all about him and inside him, and yet somehow, somewhere in a deep dark corner of his conscious, he remembered the cold voice from his dreams. His smile shortened a bit but he forced his thoughts back into the moment; “I won’t fail you, sir” he told his mentor.


Sara was jubilant. The rose had worked wonders to start off the evening and the news about his promotion only lengthened the bliss. She was talking about his new role and responsibilities, but his mind was not in those words. He was lost in her joy, her soft pink lips seemed to engulf his whole vision. Ahhh, he could just sit and watch that face for eternity. She was looking at him with amusement and was speaking something that was simply music to his ears. Then she lifted her hand and swayed it in front of his eyes. “Hello!” she said with a chuckle, “Are you even listening?” she asked. “Of course, yes” he lied. She knew he lied, and he knew she knew. Yet she asked “Alright, so what will you be wearing now that you’re a manager?” to which Kelly joked “Umm, the manager costume?” and laughed. She laughed too, but then said “Just so you know, your jokes suck, but I like the way you laugh!” and laughed again. They looked at each other with eyes sparkling from recent mirth, and she spoke softly, “Your eyes are so...” as the distance between them closed. “...so what?” he asked equally softly, taking her face in his hands, not expecting an answer. She mumbled something barely audible, but he felt it on her breath, now mingling with his own. Both their hearts were beating out of their chests, and in a rush of air & heat, their lips met. The moment was both timeless and over in an instant, mostly because the ground had suddenly started shaking violently beneath their feet. Sara broke off first and had barely exclaimed “Earthquake!?!” when it over as quick as it came. “That kiss was literally Earth shattering, huh?” she joked, but as she looked over at Kelly, her fingers found cold sweat on his brows and dead fear in his eyes. “Hey, it’s okay. We’re okay!” she consoled him. Yet she could only look as he calmed himself enough to speak. “I wanted to tell you something. About the dreams – nightmares, which I’m having...”



Chapter 12



Niyensi made rapid progress in the following weeks. Once she happened upon the big city she so eagerly looked forward to, she decided to stay away from large human settlements there on. The absolute filth, of their own making no less, in which they dwelled filled her with disgust. More so, she was appalled by the total apathy with which everyone treated one another. She had picked up several stranded individuals and wanderers off alleyways and no one cared. Not that she ate them all, several she simply sucked dry of information and left them with a dazed memory of those events. Rest were not so lucky. Also, not all time in the city was wasted on sightseeing and local cuisine. First, she had collected enough information for her maiden voyage to the west. She knew what to expect when she landed on those shores. Next, she realized that she had the ability to “insert” subtle instructions in weak human minds – manipulate them to her liking. A desirable trick, one she practiced every chance she got, getting better with each try.


After considerable stay in the city and having munched on enough brains and soft limbs, she shot out like an arrow to her destination. She didn’t need much sleep, and she knew which major routes to avoid. With enough food in her belly, her lithe limbs carried her with haste as she covered the entire distance from eastern side of the island to the south-western port in a matter of few weeks. The port was simply known as “North Harbor”, which confused her because it was to the south of the Island. Nevertheless, she watched the movement of people in and around the port from a vantage point. Not that there was a big crowd present, the next ship to set sail wasn’t expected for another couple of days, but those that were present betrayed points of interest that she would require later on - the ticket counter, the queue point, the boarding ledge, among other locations. She would need the “currency” to “purchase” a ticket. Although all this was new to her, the concept of trade wasn’t and she was quick enough to catch on. She needn’t worry about the purchase, for she had lifted enough currency off of her victims in city to cover her journey in style, and then some. Her idle hand reached her pouch which jingled as she had expected. Her mind was planning the excursions for the night and coming days before the journey – get enough rest on land, while she can; get the tickets as soon as they’re available, preferably for a secluded room facing the front; a guise of a well-off woman perhaps? But not too young, else she’ll be pestered by overly-enthusiastic men the whole time...


Just as Niyensi was fixing her disguise, her pouch started jingling slightly. She sensed tremors coming from the sea and soon beneath her body that were causing the jingles. Somewhere down in the harbor, the sign post for queue start fell sideways. The tremors passed on further north within a couple of breaths. “This was no common quake” she concluded, “something big must’ve happened beneath to cause such an effect on the surface!” She felt a slight tug of fear in her heart, for she was always wary of the unknown. There was much about this whole business that she didn’t know - powerful entities and ancient relics were involved. She cozied up further down to the ground, hoping for more tremors but also, more realistically, gleaning knowledge from the land. Magic always left traces. Her intuition was right, for the tremors had a magical origin, their epicenter at the very south – further beyond the vast seas. After some time, when her hope for more tremors faded, she got up and dusted the dirt off her apparel that she had “borrowed” from a city shop. She went back to her modest camp and decided to rest. Niyensi realized that being in action suited her best. Planning, manipulation, strategizing and out-witting opponents brought the best in her. But this deceptively simple task of resting brought her demons to fore. The fear of what ifs, the hatred of unknown, thoughts and memories that she wasn’t sure were hers anymore... she’d rather face the elven army again than just rest! But she knew she had to; powerful as she was, she couldn’t foresee the obstacles that awaited her, and it was best to conserve strength and not need it, than to need it and not have it. And so she lost herself again in the whirlpool of her own mind, the memory of recent tremors soon turning into a vivid scene of hell’s snow storm.



Chapter 13



Anudîn hated feeling vulnerable. His actions always consisted of a well thought out process properly timed, with all eventualities considered. But now, time was short at hand. Mind links were one thing, projecting yourself somewhere was an entirely different matter. Leaving your physical body and working fully off your will was a very exhausting process, especially if it consisted of facing someone as powerful as his brother, in his own territory. It was a risk worth taking, but only if it yielded some results at the end. And so Anudîn was planning his conversation flow, as his servant tied the chain to his hand. Once all was ready, Anudîn took a deep breath and started the ancient magic ritual.


***


“Ah, brother. I expected you’d come and see me. How goes the circle of winter and its lord?” 


“You know as well as I how it goes, brother; for you can see what goes on there, as I am blind to what goes on here.”


“Is that why you’ve come, to check if I’m doing alright? If my subjects are suffering properly? Or perhaps you come to me to snoop about for a sniff of the essence and what I propose to do with it? Well Anudîn, unlike some other lords, you’re an intelligent one. Mayhap you already guessed what my intent is? Be forward brother, for I have other matters to look to.”


“So be it. I assume you intend to absorb the essence, open portals and conquer the realms. Your ambitions were never well hidden, yet as your brother and fellow lord, I must warn you. We are not meant for this. Do not unleash chaos and upset the order of creation.”


“You are as miserable as you were always, Anudîn. Tell me, oh so wise brother, what is the meaning of our long existence? Are we supposed to slurp on mortal souls till the end of time? There was once a time when I took what wasn’t mine by right, by force. I gave you a part of it too. You are where you are by my wish only. Join me brother, for I shall share each world and essence with you. This soul-bound mortal is just the beginning, once we conquer drakekin homeland, we’ll have arcane mages to hold portals to any realm we wish. So I say once again, as your brother, join me. Together we’ll be masters of all!”


“There is a natural order to all things. I am bound by my nature and duty to prevent the festering of chaos. Brother or not, consider this my final warning. Stop this madness before it consumes us all.”


“You dare threaten ME? You overstep you limits, Winter-lord. If you do not stand by me, you stand against me; as you always have. Do you believe me naïve enough not to know of your little plan, sending that creature up on surface? Fear not, for that one will not die, I require its abilities. Once it takes care of the mortal, my minions shall bring it back to me. As for you, dear brother, you shall enjoy some time on surface.”


So saying, Markerith bound Anudîn’s projection and flung it towards the surface. The force of the collision was strong enough to send shockwaves across Arda.


***


What Markerith failed to notice was that his brother’s projection was already bound to something else, in another place. This was a clever foresight on Anudîn’s part, for he slipped back into his circle aided by his servant. Kranch enquired if his lord was alright, because he looked a bit shaken. After assuaging his servant’s fears, Anudîn dismissed him, and started ruminating on his recent encounter with his brother.


Markerith will not be looking for him, he knew, for his brother was smug of his power and was already busy planning his next move; which Anudîn now knew. Markerith intended to let the drakekin kill the boy, absorb his essence as his soul flowed into hell, while his minions captured the drakekin. Once the essence is absorbed, he’ll overrun the surface and absorb all the mortals, then open a portal to drakekin homeland to further his conquest. He’ll use Anudîn’s arcane drakekin to secure the portal.


Anudîn shook his head wryly. His brother had truly gone mad. His plan entirely depended on foolhardy prowess, due to which he had failed to notice several loopholes in his plan. If the drakekin kills the boy, his essence may be fractured; moreover, the soul may flow into the winter circle. Also, he expected the drakekin to just go along with his plan? Anudîn realized he must not underestimate his brother, for he may as well have just fed Anudîn misinformation. His minions may already be on their way to kill the boy, ensuring his essence reaches Markerith and then capture the drake-kin. He must contact the drake-kin, now that it was all out war. And he must do it fast, before his brother realizes Anudîn was not bound to surface as he expected. Things were taking a turn for worse very fast and time was not on their side. He must act in haste before the ruin of all.
