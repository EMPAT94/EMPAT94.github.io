<p>Hello! I'm Pritesh. Welcome to my site. Here lies the messy collection of my life's experiences and imaginations. You may start off by reading any of the posts below, or you can check out my projects in the header above.</p> 

<p>I have also added a bit of stuff about me, including my best attempt at a portrait and ways of forwarding your praises (or rants) to me, in the <a href="/about">About</a> section.</p>

<p>In any case, have a good time and visit again :)</p>
