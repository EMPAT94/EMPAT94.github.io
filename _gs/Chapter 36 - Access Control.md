## Chapter 36 - [Work in Progress]

It was to a throbbing mother of all headaches that welcomed me as I came to. The loud yelling match outside wasn't helping in the least. 'I thought my days of nasty hangovers were behind me. What the hell happened?'

As my mind slowly gained awareness, I realized my ankles were bound tight by a frayed rope. There was a rough stinky rag stuffed in my mouth that I dare not move, for fear of lodging it deeper in. My throat was drier than desert sand. Lying down in the surprisingly cool floor, I looked around for clues of my current predicament. I noticed I was inside some manner of large tent. The yelling outside has not subsided. Focusing on the clamour, I heard a female voice - piercing and shrill not unlike a woman's who just found out her man has been entirely honest with her, and a calm male voice, sounding like a man who has had years to develop a wall of tolerance that would put a fortress to shame. Unfortunately, while my imagination filled in the gaps I still couldn't hear the actual words being spoken. Not for long though, as the voices seemed to be coming closer.

Not wanting anything to do with a couple quarrel, I got up ready to sneak away. Or tried to, atleast. Soon I noticed that my wrists were tied up as well. I was fully awake now, and everything that had happened crashed into my conscious as the god-freaking-damn honest-to-goodness Centaurs walked in. I still couldn't belive they were real, despite one having thwaked my head to kingdom come. I pretended to stay asleep.

"I see you are awake, human." The same male voice as previous spoke softly. 'Ah well.. There goes that budding plan.'

I moved some muscles that I hadn't used in years and managed to fumble only twice before I was in a slighly more dignified position of sitting on the dirt floor with legs splayed out and straining my neck up to look at the horse monsters staring down on me. The man - no, Centaur dude had a mask of stone for face. I could barely imagine what he was thinking. The Centaur dudette on the other hand, was boring a hole in me with barely contained fury and contempt. Funny I could read that despite her eyes being big round balls of black. Cute on small dogs and play dolls, terrifying on horse-human hybrids. Both of them were tanned and dressed to the nines in elaborately sewed clothes, supplemented by painted wooden and bone ornaments.

"Aaffoo" I send a 'Hello' through the rags. I quickly checked if I could target the constraints and slip off using incendio, and felt a slight relief when I realised I could. 'Will have to wait for the right time.'

"Tyee, this cannot-" the female started, only to be stopped short by the dude, aparentlly named Tyee.

"Nina, please. Atleast wait until **[Vast Ocean]** Kai has had her attendance." The words got a bit jumbled when he spoke of 'Kai', like there was no translation for it. What I heard and what was said seemed slightly off, even though I was pretty sure they guy was talking in English from the way his lips moved. As I noticed the cracks in simulation for the first time, the lady Centaur, Nina snorted - not in the horse but human way, and walked away with stomping steps. I doubted that was the last I saw of her.

The Centaur Tyee watched her walk away. Once she was out of the tent, he spoke up. "My apologies, both for her behaviour and your treatment, this wasn't quite how I imagined I would meet the saviour of our world. May I remove your bindings?" I nodded. Tyee then bent in the most unhuman-fashion and helped me stand up before un-gagging my mouth and freeing my hands. "I'm afraid I cannot reach your legs, you must untie them yourself," he motioned as I rubbed my numb palms. Soon I was free of the rope on my legs as well.

"My name is Tyee Dakota, I belive humans would call me a Medicine Man of Dakota tribe. I wish we had met under better circumstances." He did a quick bow. I bet Centaurs did core-training since birth, no wonder each one had abs for days.

"I'm Pat. Mage. So what happens now?" I sent a quick Identify in his direction while he mulled over a reply.

## **[Calm Wind]** Tyee Dakota Level ??

'Calm Wind? What sort of class is that?'

"For now, I shall have some food and water brought in. Later, our... Seer Kai would like to have words with you. Please rest assured, no harm will come to you today." He replied. I nodded again, which he must've taken as assent to have refreshments brought in. So the Centaur trotted outside while I began to form possible questions I could ask him and plan for an escape. As I stared at Tyee leaving the tent, flap halfway concealing his human body outside, I wondered how their pysiology even worked. Do they have digestive systems of both a man and horse? Yuck. Biologically, this anatomy made zero sense. My doubts over whether charachters in this world were real edged back towards negative.

Before my thoughts could dive into that pit, I pull them back towards my current _life and death_ sitaution. I was presumable a prisoner of war, but they needed me for something due to me being a Hero. Perhaps I could leverage it and sneak away? But I need to know where I am first. Hopefully, not too far away from Galihad. I bet Carol & Arya are searching for me and Phillipe already. 'Phillipe? Damn it, where is the kid?'

I started to make way outside just as the flap opened and Tyee strode in with a large tray. I immediatly rounded up on him. "Where's the kid that was with me?"

"I presume you speak of the young one that you held on to when the warriors decended? The colt is safe. Us Centaurs do not hurt foals. Our honor demands we meet warriors in fair combat, not little ones who have no glory yet." He handed me a mug from the tray, it was filled with water. "It was only you that the party brought back. The 'kid' was left behind at the magic walls."

"I see, that's good then." I took a sip from the mug, after ensuring nothing visible floating inside, surprised to find it cool and refreshing. " I heard you guys wanted Hero Carol."

"Yes. I requested a group of willing humans to set up a meeting with one of the Heros on behalf of Kai. They mentioned a Scout-Hero. I assume I must to refuse them now that fate has brought another Hero here." He spoke wistfully. 'Does he not know?'

"They... they kidnapped her! Killed her mentor and dragged her day and night to hand-off to you lot!" I almost threw the mug in his face.

"Ah, I'm sorry. It was not my intent to harm anyone. Kai simply wished to speak and I requested the same from them." He did look apologetic, but it was hard to say.

"And why does Kai want to speak with a Hero?" I asked instead, taking another sip. My dry throat was setting down now, but it left the hunger in my stomach to rise its head.

"It is best if Kai herself spoke on that matter." He motioned towards the tray in his hand. I looked around for a place to put the mug but the tent was suspiciosly empty for furnishings. I shrugged, put the mug down on ground and took the tray from him. It had what looked to be a pieces of boiled sweet potatoe and roasted maize. I took one piece and tasted it. 'Satisfactory!'

"Who were the guys you made a deal with? I thought humans and Centaurs were at war," I asked.

"On the whole, yes, we are. But not _all_ of us fight _all_ of them. There are some among out tribes who wish for peace. Many others seek glory instead. Most would rather not concern themselves with the war but our hands have been forced, so to speak. That being said, contacts outside of battle-field still happen." He lifted his front hoof and stamped it down. I wonder what it signified. "We helped the humans during the Goblin Wars when the horrid creatures sought refuge in our territories. Since then, several tribes have traded with the humans as well - their metal, magic equipment, and knowledge for our maize, squash, beans and cloth."

"I see. So how did it come to war then? And I was given to understand that Centaurs _love_ to fight, so why would anyone want peace?" I tried another peace.

"Centaurs warriors love to fight, yes. They seek glory. A worthy challange. Humans, you fight for conquest. Take freedom from those who lose. It is not our way," he replied.

I had no response to that, mostly because he was right. I decided to ask something else that had been nagging at me for a while.

"So what's Nina's deal then?" I asked as I wondered how to finish the maize without looking like a savage.

"Please forgive Nina, she is... grieving." His hoof scraped the hard-packed dirt floor. "She lost her husband previous harvest when humans first attacked. And her son was injured in the last raid. It is not known if he will survive. She is not herself."

'So she hates all humans with a passion. Can't say I'm surprised.'

"I'm guessing she is not in the lets-make-peace faction." I decided to attack the maize as whole. I was hungry and not one to stand on ceremony.

"No, she is not." He replied, all too seriously. "She was a wonderful woman once. Kind, playful, always with a smile on her face. But conflict and sorrow has changed her. Brought out the worst in her."

I stopped chewing for a moment.

"Her husband, my brother, was our chief. He wanted peace, but an assasin's dagger struck him in the dark of night. Nina belives all humans to be honorless tricksters since. Now that her son lies injured, she holds the mantle as the tribe's cheif until he recovers. Please do not seek her provocation."

"Ofcourse, I'm not one to ruffle feathers. Don't worry." I got back to the food and made light conversation with Tyee despite the circumstances.
