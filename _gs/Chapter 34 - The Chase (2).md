<br />

The journey continued as the sun exhausted its last light upon an entourage riding with grave purpose. Pretty soon, it became dark enough that even watching the scenery stream by outside became impossible. I wanted to go through the "Utility Spells and their Origin" book I borrowed from Neysa but the carriage was _just_ bouncy enough to make it reading burden. Never having traveled for so long, and with no means of distraction, boredom threatened to creep in my mind. Even Arya had started looking listless between her bouts of worry and rage. The young prince was asleep in the bundle of warm blankies in the corner.

"They look so life-like, don't they?" I wondered out aloud.

"What do you mean?" Arya replied, listlessness disappearing from her eyes.

"These NPCs. They seem so realistic." I repeated.

"Pat... I think they are real." She replied, glancing at the bundle in the corner.

"Oh, what makes you think so?" I was curious. I had yet to make up my mind about the denizens of this world. For the most part, I considered them characters generated by the same creators who made the simulation. But the last few days I spent among these "characters" increasingly challanged that perception.

"Umm, It's hard to pin it down to one thing. They are just so... so...", the bundle in the corner moved, a part of cloth slipping to reveal an innocent face resting peacefully.

"Real?" I finished, both of us staring at the lighly snoring form. I decided to postpone any conclusion on the matter. Our conversations so far had inevitably lead to either Carol or silence, so I tactfully forced another topic. "Well, atleast magic is real."

She chuckled at that and continued, "You havn't been experimenting lately?"

"Naw, it's been like 5 days since we left tutorial?" She nodded, I continued. "First couple were spent talking and resting. There was that parade and stuff the next. Yesterday I spent the whole time reading random books. And today-"

"Today, you spend the whole time in a carriage. But why did you not experiment in the carriage then?" She queries.

"Apparently, when spells go wrong, they go _really wrong_. Like mad science explosions." I recalled Neyssa's lesson. "Didn't wanna take the risk here."

"But you've done it before, on the bridges. Did you not say that your spells are different from what Mages do here? Why not try something benign, you know waterball or... Hey, how about light? Like those magical lamps back in the palace?" She concluded, her voice rising.

I thought about it. It really had been a while since I added a new spell to my repo. And now I had a kinda-sorta reference book as well. "Utility Spells and their Origin" was a thin Spellbook with about a dozen "open-source" spells that were taught to novice Mage kids for practice. Unfortunately for me, it was _not_ filled with programs, but with esoteric nonsense like sift the wind, feel the energy and other vague bullshit. This led me to belive that a "spell repository" and especially Spells themselves were shows differently to different Mages, depending on how they thought they best interacted with the world. I was almost sure that I would see some sort of poetry in Neyssa's Status Window instead of code like mine, if she has only opened it up. Anyho, I could still parse natural phenomenon from the esoterics and build something resembling a Spell out of it. Thus, I pulled out the book from an easily accessible pocket, skimmed through the pages and paused at what I thought resembled a "light" spell.

"Dark is a manifestation of ignorace. Verily, Light is the knowledge that dispells it." Arya whispered, her voice close by my side nearly tingling my ears. 'When the hell did she change places?' She must've noticed my look. "You get so absorbed when reading..." 'Well, true.' "Anyway, are you sure this is a light spell? Looks like a mish-mash of words to me."

I glanced below the opening title and read out the contents. "But hate not the Dark, for it is a vessel. A child new to the world in an empty vessel, born in the dark and came to Light. It learns the lessons of its ancestors and thus the vessel is filled with knowledge. And Dark turns to Light."

"Hmmm..." Arya hummed and pointed to a section on the page. "I think this is the meat of this Spell, the rest if fluff. Here," She began reading, "Wield the knowledge that fills thy vessel, as a fire rages against the wind and yet cannot survive without it; as the Sun - the greatest of the holy fires, dispels the ignorance of night; so shall thee harness thy... blah blah... lightning in the storm... blah blah... sparks of Light into a steady lamp that burns through the night. Hmm, it keeps going like that."

"Yes, that tells me exactly what to do." I stared into her eyes with a deadpan face.

She slapped my shoulder lightly and snorted. "Oh come on, atleast we know they it is connected to fire and lightning. And the Sun, I think?"

"Right, right... Guess we should get a fusion going then?" Me, still with a stiff expression, hoping to express the depths of my sarcasm.

"Don't be an ass. Try something already. What about LEDs? Can you copy how they work?" She chided me. 'Hmmm, not a bad idea. I already know how to generate small voltages. Maybe she is on to something...'

I scrounged up memories from my junior college lessons on electronics. Light Emitting Diodes are basically special semiconductors; they emit light when electrons jump into empty places and release photons. 'These empty places, are they called holes? Since I can generate a potential difference, I have a bunch of electrons ready to jump. Do I need to create these holes separately? I need to form a junction somehow. And also adjust the distance such that they emit light instead of just heat...' I was so lost in my ruminations that I almost missed the carriage halting. Even the kid had woken up in the meantime, Arya having left me to my thoughts and conversing with him. There was a knock on the carriage door and opened to reveal a figure clad in grey. "We've reached Monoreth, we will camp here for the night and leave at dawn. Does anyone need anything?" I shook my head, Arya replied in negative. "What about you, your highness? Having a plesant trip?" She stared at the kid with a hint of smile on her face. It was difficult to make out in the dark though. THe kid murmured something and decided the carriage floor was the most interesting thing ever. Seline chuckled. "Come on out by the campfire later, ther should be some stew and bread ready to go."
