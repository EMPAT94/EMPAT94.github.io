# Volume 2 - A Dying World

## Chapter 26 - Bootstrap

As the teleportation light faded from my vision, I immediately turned back. Half expecting a horde of nutty monsters, I breathed a sigh of relief when instead of monsters, I was surrounded by opulent NPCs. If the tropes were to be believed, it would be one king or another begging us to go fight a demon lord or some such.

I noticed the glow dimming from the circle of Runes beneath my feet. I discreetly aimed an Identify at the whole motif. A window of "Summoning Circle" appeared.

'Interesting... Runes are individual constructs, and multiple Runes can be connected to form a "Circle". Not unlike using singular functions in the main program. I will have to individually check each Rune later, perhaps it can help me in teleporting back home.'

I left it at that, deciding to inspect the NPCs instead. 'Here I thought my robes were high class. Their clothes make ours look like low-end casual wear.' And their clothes suited their alluring faces. All the men were statuesque, and women bewitching. Honestly, I was starting to feel a bit envious.

I felt one of them looking at me fixedly. She was right behind the one who I assumed was in charge. She quickly averted her eyes, a slight blush coloring her cheeks. 'Cute. Considering these are NPCs, the level of details is approaching creepy! If I was back home, I would not have been able to distinguish them from real humans.'

Soon, the NPC in charge walked forward. I hoped he won't drone on - I had no MP, barely any SP, and around a third of HP remaining.

"Heroes, welcome!" 'Oh, so we are heroes from the get-go then? That saves some trouble.'

"I am Siegfried Von Lohengramm, head of clan Lohengramm and current leader of the Clan Council." 'Clan Council? Not a King or an Emperor?'

He stopped for a breath, perhaps hoping his words held significance to us. I had no clue though. None of my companions spoke either.

"Please, do not worry, everyone here is an ally. These are my peers and fellow members of the Council. Our representatives will lead you to your rooms to take care of subsistence and repose." 'Oh, done already? Good.'

Thankfully, the guy ended his speech quickly. I bet he took pity on us. 'I ain't complaining, food and rest sound like heaven right now!'

As soon as he said that, a young girl NPC from the side latched onto Taro. Another guy came and conversed with Julie. I noticed some hesitation from the remaining two women when the other ran to Divin. The one who stared at me earlier walked towards me with a bland face.

"Greetings sir," she said - bending down and picking up her flowing gown slightly, "I'm princess Francisa Von Lohengramm, at your service. May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?"

'Oh... A princess NPC?' I was a bit surprised. I assumed we were summoned by a cult, given the introduction by "clan head", but there was actually a princess here. 'Another thing to investigate, if time permits.'

"I'm Pat. Nice to meet ya. Guess you're stuck with me, eh?" I joked, hoping to break the ice a bit.

She let her gown go and took an unwavering posture, giving off a smile that didn't reach her eyes. 'This is not _approaching_ creepy, it totally is. This NPC is giving me the stink-eye!'

"Oh no. It is an honor, sir... Pat. Please, follow me. I shall guide you to your room." she said coldly. 'Is this supposed to happen? Isn't the princess supposed to fawn over the heroes?'

I looked at our group. Taro was already being escorted off by the young girl... 'Princess', probably to his room. The rest, however, exchanged unspoken words with each glance. 'Looks safe, should follow the NPCs for now.'


<br /> <p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p> <br />

'Ah, I had forgotten how good hot water feels against the skin! Especially when you are exhausted.'

Lazing about in the bath, I almost forgot that I was inside a simulation. The bath felt magical indeed, relieving the tension I did not know I held. As much as I would have liked to, however, I could not stay in there forever. Eventually, the water turned cold and I got out dripping the remnant drops on the marble floor. I wiped the moisture off and put on the loose clothes left by one of the maids. 'I wonder what's for dinner?' I hummed a merry tune as I got back into my room.

I slowly opened the door, then stopped right there, stunned for a moment at the sight. The princess NPC had changed clothes! Now wearing a silky black night-gown that barely reached her knees, she arranged the plates and laid some food for us both. My sight wandered over her body for quite a while, since she hadn't noticed me yet. Her attention was not on the task at hand, lost in her own world. I watched with silent mirth as a circus of emotions passed her beautiful face. A moment of apprehension, another of determination. A slight shame here, a bit of sadness there. Some excitement, some shyness. So much realism, that for a moment my mirth turned into pity. Her attire, behavior, sentiments - hell, her very presence left me in no doubt of her purpose here.

'Doesn't this part come later, typically at the end?'

And yet in the reversal of common lore, here stood this young woman, bare a couple of years younger than me. I did not know why she was doing this, but I was pretty sure she did not fall for me in the few minutes that we talked and walked. Whatever her circumstances were, I myself was a bit alarmed about the whole situation. It would've felt just right in a dream; in the real world (or as real as this simulation could get), I had other concerns. First, I had great reservations about such an obviously reluctant offer. Second, I doubted there was any protection method present. I did not want to catch anything nor leave anything behind. My decision made, I coughed lightly to bring her attention back from the clouds.

She looked up startled, almost dropping a dollop of porridge-like stuff on the table. 'Hmm... Even the reactions are exceptionally life-like. I wonder what manner of data-structures are driving these? There's surely an ML layer behind all this, perhaps even multiple pseudo-intelligent overseer AIs like Betty.'

I drove the thought of Betty out of my mind. 'This gorgeous NPC princess demands your focus right now!' I mentally reeled myself. I had to take care of how I interacted with them; for all I knew, my words and actions could also affect the main storyline like several other games from back home.

"Sir Pat, forgive my presumption. I was hoping to dine with you tonight if it so pleases you," she lay the spoon down and curtsied again. Given her awkward stance though, I realized it was more out of habit or nervousness than anything else. She flustered a bit, hands clutching air instead of non-existent skirts. I pretended at having not seen her dither, instead smiled and said, "Of course, it would be my honor to dine with you."

Saying so, I took my seat. I was pretty sure that I was being rude in some way. She gripped her length on her gown and pressed it downwards, hoping to cover her legs some more perhaps. Instead, the action emphasized another part, rather parts, of herself. Fiddly as can be, she dragged the chair back and sat herself down. 'Oh shoot, was I supposed to do that?'

I mentally kicked myself for missing that. My hunger soon brought my attention back to the plate though. Sure, I never starved in the Tutorial, but I had gone for a month without food. It had left a void in my heart. And stomach. The roasted chicken and mashed potatoes in butter were simply paradise. I left the supposed porridge aside - too sweet. Sips of wine instead? Just right.

We ate dinner in silence. I was indeed curious about many things, but it could wait. The food demanded and deserved my full attention. I did not know what the princess ate, or if she had at all, but she was done before I was. As I wiped my plate clean and gave a sigh of satisfaction with a rub over my tight belly, I felt sweet fatigue wash over me.

I excused myself from the table and went to wash off, assuming the maids would clean the table off later. 'The princess should get a clue with this.' I immediately jumped into bed and dragged the covers on my prone form. It was damn cold, and that was okay. It felt right somehow.


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

My elation did not last for long. The maid did not come to clean up the table. Neither did the princess make herself scarce. No, she did the exact opposite. She slid herself under the covers.

I was flabbergasted. Never have I ever been in a situation where a pretty lady came on to me so strongly and I wanted nothing of it. Thankfully, she kept her hands to herself.

"S-Sir Pat, I..." she stuttered in a morose whisper. She jumped into my bed and _then_ got cold feet? NPC or not, I was starting to feel sympathy for her. I opened my eyes and looked into her deep blue ones. So caught in her melancholic beauty was I that for a moment I forgot to breathe. Only for a moment though, as I spoke up:

"I'm sorry, princess. I've been fighting monsters practically non-stop for a whole month. Normally, you would see me act very differently, so don't take this as a fault on your part. I am simply burned out and want to sleep." I said, hoping my words were kind yet firm. I saw a mixture of relief and disappointment on her face, quickly hidden behind a mask of understanding. 'Girl, make up your mind already. You are making _me_ feel indecisive, and I have already made my decision!'

"I understand. Please accept my apologies and forgive my forwardness!" she asserted, sliding out of the bed. "I shall come at sunrise tomorrow. I hope sir Pat has a restful night."

"Um... Yes. Goodnight." I felt a bit guilty about throwing her out. I wasn't kidding about the burn-out though, I was asleep within a minute after she was gone.


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

I woke up just before dawn. The window was facing my bed, so the pre-dawn light made its way right onto my snoring face. I forcefully opened my eyes, as the sun peaked over the window-still, gathering my thoughts over the events of the previous day.

A light knock brought me out of my stupor. I removed the dirt from my eyes and sat up in bed. "Come on in!" I responded and in came the princess and a maid. The maid cleaned the tabled and left a jar of water there, moving on to draw a bath.

"Good morning, sir Pat!" the princess greeted. I could see her resolve remade, blue eyes bright like the sky outside was turning into. Even her dress was an odd mix of blue folds and pink frills. 'The nightgown suits her figure better,' I appraised thoughtfully.

"Morning, princess!" I greeted back. We tactfully skipped over last night's misadventures. "Here to have breakfast?" I asked.

"Yes, if sir Pat doesn't mind my company?" she said. I replied an affirmative and she signal another maid, who was presumably standing outside waiting for the order, to lay out the food.

I got out of the bed and drank deeply from the jar, making my way towards the toilet. Yes, with sleep and food, the other parts of my anatomy had kick-started as well. The toilet itself was, from a distance at least, no different than a modern western toilet. Get close and you'd notice that it was actually a proper chair with a hole in the center. Closer still and you'd notice all the Runes decorating it inside and out. I noticed at least three different disinfection Runes. Either way, I was thankful I did not have to go in a pot.

Soon after finishing my business, I made my way to the bath after the earlier maid vacated, just in time to see a Rune fizzle out. 'A temporary heat Rune? I've learned more about Runes in the last 24 hours than the entire previous month!' Cursing the futility of the Tutorial and not loitering long like last night, I quickly made my way towards breakfast, sitting in front of the beaming princess.

"I shall show sir Pat around the palace grounds after breakfast, then we shall attend to the throne room for lunch with the other heroes and clan heads," she laid out my agenda like it was natural, "if sir Pat obliges, I would like to give a small tour of the noble quarters in the evening as well." I wondered how the nights of the rest of my fellow test-subjects had been. 'Guess we'll talk at lunch directly.'

"Sounds like a plan. And, uh, call me Pat. Just Pat." I chuckled. Mixing "sir" with my nickname and coming out the mouth of a princess felt quite odd.

"If it pleases you si- Pat. I would appreciate it if you called me Francisa as well," she grinned back.

"Will do, Francisa. So, I was wondering, and do forgive me if I offend in some way, but you are a princess, right? Are there kings and queens as well? How do the clan and their head factor in the hierarchy?" I questioned after chewing a mouthful of fresh bread.

She looked up at me from her own loaf, collecting her thoughts. I could feel her getting ready for a lecture. "Our ancestors were actually the ones who were kings and queens. Clan Lohengramm had a kingdom once, back when my grandfather was but a child. Circumstances, however, forced us to gather here. All the families you met yesterday were of royal blood, but none of our kingdoms exist anymore. Nor do we have space or resources to form any on this continent. Hence, we formed a new way of governance. Royal families became clans, and we rule this part of the human lands with the Clan Council, a congregation of former royals. Being called princess is just a vestige of lost time."

I wonder what these "circumstances" actually were. I was torn between my brain insisting that these "people" weren't truly real and my heart tugging at the extremely vivid depiction of sadness that veiled this pretty girl's face. I slapped myself mentally - 'the princess was monologuing her clan's story and current affairs, I should be paying attention.' I was hanging on to her every word, unwilling to miss even the slightest detail.

And so our breakfast continued, merrily discussing seemingly trite matters, the dark memories of last night's incident long forgotten.

## Chapter 27 - Lay of Land

Breakfast was normal. Strips of crisp bacon, a couple of eggs, some brown bread, and another sweet drink.

Feeling my trouser tighten a bit around my waist, I called it quits. The princess did eat, after all, but in small bits held in dainty hands with quick moves that were quite hard to notice. When you did notice it, there was an indisputable grace to the motion; having the effect of making me feel like a brute. Not that she mentioned it.

After the hearty breakfast, she led me to the gardens on the backside of the Palace. Well, calling them gardens was a bit of an understatement - they felt more like an environmental landscape artist decided to go crazy on experimentation.

The "front" gardens were more for showing off, and for having large areas for parties and events. The "back" gardens, where I was currently examining what looked like a pink daffodil, were for private conversations and relaxing.

Sitting under the shade of an awning and nursing another sweet drink in her hand, the princess was currently expanding my knowledge on local geography.

"... And so, this is both a frontier and last line of defense for humanity. My great-grandfather - honored King Alexander Von Lohengramm, noticed the signs of creeping calamity long before other nations. Thus, he began the colonization of this continent of Alteraz. Eventually, the kingdom could not hold out any longer, so he sent my grandfather, then merely 19 years of age, to continue the line here while he himself stayed back. Many nobles of our kingdom followed his example, sending their sons and daughters along with my grandfather to the new lands," she took a sip before continuing, "of course, there was the prophecy as well, it pointed to a dungeon here. Alteraz is where the heroes shall defeat the calamity and the world will be safe once again!"

'Did she just casually mention a dungeon?' Before I could interrupt, she pushed on. When it comes to talking about her family history, she just kept going on and on.

"And so, my grandfather formed an alliance with four other clans. They weren't more than bridgeheads back then, but now the former alliance rules as the five major clans. The clan system was actually formalized by my father himself! And my big brother was -" she stopped, slight shock apparent on her face. I remember her mentioning her little brother, this was the first time I heard about a big brother. I gave her a moment, as she hesitated. She spoke in a small voice, "Big brother was supposed to be the first official overseer."

Her fingers trembled slightly. Moisture clouded her eyes. 'Why is this cut scene making my heart squidge?'

After a practiced deep breath, a mournful smile decorated her features. "He was last seen on the wrong side of the high passes," she spoke with fool's hope. After a minute of silence, she pronounced, "Oh! Look at me, rambling on. The Sun is almost past the zenith, perhaps we should head inside for the luncheon?"


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

In the several hours since breakfast till noon, I got a crash course on the surrounding terrain, historical intrigues, and the current political situation of this continent named Alteraz.

This continent was also supposedly the only inhabitable one left. Others were taken over by the calamity. I was still unclear on exactly what it was.

So, the disaster started off on the other side of the planet, slowly covering a larger area with time. All the sapient species, at least those that could traverse the oceans, sailed ahead of it. Eventually ending up gathering here. Even I could imagine the chaos this would imply.

The native inhabitants of this region - the eastern part of the continent, were goblins and beast tribes of diverse species. Goblins had been wiped out a few years before Francisa was born. By the time she celebrated her tenth birthday, a majority of the beast tribes had been subjugated. The annexation of Centaur lands was currently underway. There was also an incursion of faeries back when humans initially marched in when they overran the southern forests, but not much is known about their whereabouts now.

The central area was littered with high mountains. An entire mountain range split the continent in two. I imagined this was probably due to there being two different continents that collied into one. Not unlike the Himalayas when India bumped into Asia.

In any case, the highest mountains graced the northernmost parts and were occupied by, unsurprisingly, the Dragons. There were large sub-terrain worms that dug in a little south. The central area was taken in by Dwarves. Well, the central area deep inside the mountains at least, perhaps even below sea level. Further south were the caves of Drows. There was a large forested area to the south that covered a better part of the mountains and flowed on either side of it.

Also somewhere high up in the mountains, near the Dwarven territory, were the "high passes" that humans held. This place was a window to the other side of the continent. On the other side, there were reports of Elven constructs and Orcish hordes. Not much was known beyond that.

Of course, these were only some of the major players on the continent. "Civilized" people, so to speak. Innumerable creatures roamed the vast "uncivilized" areas that were being quickly engulfed by the former. I learned that the mammoths, crocs, and squid-face went extinct hundreds of years ago. Panthers still resided in the south. About the rest of the creatures, they were either common or unknown. Quite a dichotomy.

An optimistic estimate was that humans currently reigned supreme in the eastern continent - bar the "uncivilized" regions as it were.


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Closer to home, there were about thirteen clans spread out all over the human-occupied lands ranging from the eastern coast to central mountains. Five were considered as major clans, the ones from the original invasion alliance. They were also closer to the center. Apparently, I was one clan's area away from the mountains - one could see them if they go to the front gardens. The rest were under the oversight of these five clans in one way or another.

This was a very new system of governance, not even two generations old. And so there were the typical ones who wanted to rise above others, others who sought to pull the former down. There were even such forces among the major clans. Francisa all but mentioned that her brother was a victim to these political plays and not the minacious posting at the border.

All that was about the nobles. The commoners, instead, played a different game. Needless to say, petty criminals were commonplace. Serious crimes were widespread as well. But these things were par for the course. What concerned Francisa the most, and by that I mean her father - I doubt she was viewing the situation from her own perspective, was the new church of convulsion. This church believed that the ongoing cataclysm was a sign from the gods. Their gospel was that humans should fight the monster hordes that heralded the disaster, allying instead of conquering other sapient species. The more radical members of the church were convinced that the world was going to end because the humans had strayed from the righteous path and this was their just reward. It was funny how even NPC humans were inclined to consider themselves the center of everything - even a catastrophe. The problem arose, however, when one of their core beliefs was that heroes were against the natural order of things, the belief that had led to numerous troubles so far. Indeed, hearing about their exploits made me re-imagine them more as an assassin's guild than a godly church.

Such was the situation where I was summoned into - war on all fronts, people tearing each other's throats out, and an inevitable doom closing in on us. This world was fucked to hell and back!


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

I arrived at the summoning hall following Francisa, which was being doubled as a throne room and dining hall. 'Shit, they scrubbed the Runes!'

I nodded at the NPCs and smiled at my companions, of whom everyone but Taro was already present. Julie sent a weary smile back. Carol seemed amused by something. Divin nodded back without a smile. Arya was fuming. I took a seat amidst them, all of us seating on one side of the table. Francisa took the seat facing me on the other side. Apparently, each of the representatives had taken a seat in front of their partners.

The prince NPCs ahead of Carol and Arya sat in a rigid posture, staring at the table with expressionless eyes and stony faces. The one in front of Julie instead had a natural serious expression one would expect as such an occasion. The princess with Divin sat with a finger on her chin, eyes far away in thought.

I sat beside Carol, who immediately leaned over and whispered, "Didja, ya know...?" and glanced at Francisa.

"Naw... I'm not that stupid ya know." I retorted. She raised her hand in mock apology, saying something about men and their thinking.

It was at that moment that Taro strolled in. With the remaining princess in tow. Clinging on to each other like newlyweds. 'Damn it, they got him. Hook, line and sinker!'

Carol flashed a victorious smirk at me. I scowled back, 'His actions have no bearing on the reasoning of all men.' Her smug expression persisted, however.

Lunch was a somber affair. Besides the tasty food of course. Earlier, Francisa bemoaned never having had a full royal course that her grandfather boasted of. Food was scarce here. Yet tasteful enough for my palate. No, the somberness came from the NPCs! Especially the representatives. From the look of things, only the youngest princess had succeeded in their shared mission.

"Ahm..." the clan head stood up and cleared his throat. 'Man, at least let me enjoy my dessert first!' Uncaring of my mental protests, he continued - "Again, I would like to welcome you all. I hope our hospitality wasn't too lacking." He looked over us, pausing slightly longer on the taut princes. "As you all must have surmised, our world is currently facing a great tribulation, one which we yearn to repatriate with your fortunate aid. The Council proposed to have one clan take in one hero each to prepare you for the preordained animus." 'Does this guy walk around with a hidden dictionary or something?' "And yet, some unforeseen events have caused us to reassess our adjudication." 'Hmm? _What_ is this about?' "As such, Sir Pat, Lady Arya, and Lady Carol shall continue to dwell in our royal quarters. Sir Divin, Lady Julie, and Sir Taro have preferred to follow their representatives to respective clans for further tutelage." '_Whaaaa...?_ When did these guys decide everything?' Julie shot me an apologetic glance. Divin was stoic as usual. Taro was... Best not spoken about right now.

I barely had a chance to process this news. The leader, however, steamrolled onward. "Nevertheless, fret not over what may come. For today is a day of convalescence. The three departing heroes shall leave tomorrow afternoon, but not before a grand parade to reassure the populace!" He beamed at us; was he expecting excited "whoo" perhaps? All he got in return were affirmative grunts from Divin and Julie. I was stumped still - 'We are disbanding our party? Is it temporary then, just for training? What _does_ he mean by training though?' A thousand thoughts whirled in my head, the cold dessert in front of me left untouched.

## Chapter 28 - A Hero's Welcome (1)

"So you're leaving then?" (Me, to Julie)

"Yes. Johnathan told me about his clan - they are sort of experts in the outdoorsy things. Training at their place would prove beneficial to me as an Archer." (Julie explained)

"What about their plans for us later?" (Divin questioned)

"What are you talking about?" (Taro, doubtful)

"I talked with my representative, Anna. I got the feeling that once this calamity is over, these clans intend to retake their homelands. And they want us by their side. Having a hero to reclaim their lands will give any clan quite an edge over others." (Divin)

'Oh, so that was why...' (Me, connecting the dots)

"I don't know. It's too far off in the future." (Julie, now turning to Carol) "Carol, you should rethink your plan and join me for training."

"Nae, I told ye before. I'll be fine 'ere with Pat and Arya." (Carol)

"I'm afraid I am out of the loop. Why are we suddenly splitting up for training?" (Me, glancing about)

"Well, it's no surprise you don't know about the split. They presumed you would stay here in the first place. Anyhow, your princess should have explained the training part at least - see, our attributes increase not only by level-ups but also by exercising our skills. And these skills are a double-edged sword, for that matter. Like my True Shot skill - it doesn't matter if I can shoot a homing arrow if I misjudge the distance from my target; or worse, simply freeze during combat. This stuff needs getting used to, hence the training." (Julie)

"I see. No, she probably missed it. And she's not *my* princess. We just talked about geography and current affairs the most, with bits of history and politics." (Me, frowning) 'And near entirety of Lohengramm family past.'

"Seems our next Class Upgrade will be somewhat special." (Divin, changing topics)

"Oh, how so?" (Taro, distracted)

"I'm not sure. They will tell us before starting our training, I suppose. Does anyone else have any info?" (Divin, looking around)

"Nah, I don't think so. By the way, what's up with you Arya? Been quiet a lot." (Me, glancing at Arya, noticing sympathetic looks from Julie and Carol)

"Um, sorry was just lost in thought." (Arya)

"'Twas that goon prince, bloody minger." (Carol, bursting out) "He was quite insistent on Arya last night. I saw 'em scurry off after lunch."

"What happened?" (Divin, severely)

"Nothing! It wasn't as bad as Carol made it sound. I'm slightly astounded, is all." (Arya, smiling slightly)

'Ah, I guess the courting manners of medieval princes do not suit the sensibilities of modern women. Heh.'

The conversation died down after that. Taro was fiddling with something in his hands. His grin from earlier today returned full force.

"A-Ano... I've got this... Thing. Yeah. S-So, I'll see ya later." (Taro, almost jogging off)

No prize for guessing his destination. The rest looked on with complicated expressions. 'Let him have his fun, he'll be alright. Hopefully.'

"So, what happens when this simulation is over?" (Arya)

"What do you mean?" (Divin)

"I mean... Will we be spending the rest of our lives here? Or will it end at some definite point? Will we be back as we were before, or will the time we spend here will be gone forever? All I know is that time here goes faster than Earth. What do you think Pat?" (Arya)

"Well, the test *has* to end at some point, else there won't be any point of it. And I think it will end after we defeat this world-ending threat. Also, even if we grow gray-haired by that point, we should still end up back home as we were when we first entered." (Me)

"How did you come to these conclusions?" (Divin, with the rest listening in rapt attention)

"Hmm, this whole setup feels like a video game to me. And games end when you defeat the final boss. As for our time spent here, I think we aren't actually here physically. Simply because the Simulation itself is virtual. We are something like game characters or avatars, just based on our exact physical appearances. That is what I think, in theory." (Me) 

'At least I hope so. We could just as well be copies of our original consciousness to be discarded after the test is finished.'

"Do you think we will remember all this?" (Julie, after considering my words)

"I can't say for sure but, when a test ends, you revert the system to its original state. All the effects are temporary. And given what we've been through, I don't think memory alteration is a big deal to these guys. So, yeah..." (Me)

'Time dilation and memory modification - the perfect recipe for conducting tests on unsuspecting subjects. I bet they've been at this for a considerable time, who knows how many hapless poor sods were experimented upon beside us?'

"So, them new special effects? They're quite swick eh? And these people, are they real or what?" (Carol)

'What? I have not opened my status since coming here. Need to check up on a lot of things.'


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />


Our after-lunch soirée lasted for a while. It was just us "heroes" gathered in the back gardens. Sans Taro.

The NPCs planned to have one hero attach to one clan. That clan would take responsibility for training the hero. All five major clans were in, of course. The sixth clan, where Julie was headed, was admitted out of necessity. Either way, not one day in and we'd already upended the storyline.

Arya decided to stay at the palace. Carol opted to stay with her as well. Neither had warmed up to their prince. The girls had decided this together last night sometime. Divin presumed everyone was splitting up so he planned to go out as well. After hearing that he could've refused, he made a sour face for a while. As for the former two, Arya was getting help from the Lohengramm clan like myself. She had refused all support from the assigned representative clan. Carol instead was having her "tutor" coming over. As for me? I would have to check things out with Francisa later.

Regarding our Classes, while we *were* at the baseline, it was merely the lowest standard required to get official jobs out here. People started their leveling as young as 6 years old. By the time they grew up to 15 years, they comfortably reached level 20. A human was considered an adult at that point. Some leveled up earlier, some later in the age bracket of 13 to 19.

The fun began beyond this milestone. People take up jobs befitting their Class, usually under a mentor. What they do with their mastery of Base Classes ends up affecting the next Class Upgrade. A Craftsman who takes up farming gets a Farmer Class. A Healer who joins the clergy and starts preaching gets a priest-like Class. And there is no limit on the variety of Classes one could achieve depending on the jobs they take. Assuming they are in their evolutionary tree, of course. A Scout would end up as a very poor stable-boy if he even gets that Class. As far as Julie knew, and she was the one who knew the most in this area, the Craftsman Class had the most known branches and the Mage class had the least.

We continued sharing the knowledge we had gleaned from our NPC counterparts. I expounded on the war with Centaurs and the situation in high passes. Divin was more concerned about what the NPCs expected of us, cautioning against making ill-advised agreements and taking thoughtless actions. He feared altering the storyline too much; we might cut ourselves off from achieving the end goal.


<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />


The shadows lengthened as the sky turned orange. For a while, I imagined myself back in the Tutorial. A flash of light burst from the side.  'Betty?' All of us immediately glanced at the spherical source.

Similar bursts happened at regular distances all across the garden. "Magical Lights," Divin explained quietly.

I calmed myself. 'Getting worked up over nothing.' Besides, it was quite late. I remembered Princess had some plans for the eve. I added, "Check Magical Lights" to my quest list.

Eventually, we broke off, planning to meet again tomorrow to discuss and work out future arrangements. I arrived at my room, not surprised to see Francisa already waiting, with a badly-concealed pout.

"Greetings, *Sir* Pat." 'Ah. Here we go.'

"Hello there Francisa. Sorry, I'm a bit late; our meeting went off the rails there a bit." 'That should do it?'

"I understand. Do forgive me though, the tea has gone cold. The cakes are still edible though." She declared, proffering the sweets on the table. "I had offered to acquaint a few of my friends to Sir Pat. Shall we move it to tomorrow evening?"

"Of course. I'll be happy to meet your friends." 'No need to antagonize her further.' I took a piece of the spongy cake with a fork and place it in my mouth, sitting down in front of her. "The cake's nice!" I idly commented.

"I'm sure Anna would've appreciated your words. She'll be departing tomorrow with Sir Divin, however. Though, Hamilton will be glad to convene." She mused.

"Hmm... So Francisa, about the dungeon you mentioned..." I shot off one question after another, which she answered promptly and precisely. Francisa was quite the conversationalist once you got her going. Her formality dropped to yesterday's favorable milieu as our discussion continued. We talked at length about prophecies, monsters, magic, and of all things, civil duty and filial responsibilities, among other topics fantastical and mundane.

Soon, the Sun dipped below the horizon. I failed to notice it last night, but now I realized that instead of candles, the maids had placed magical sticks in the corner. It had Runes! And obviously, I amended my earlier to-do. Along with the magical candle came tonight's dinner, again in the company of the princess. And again I stuffed myself, just slightly lesser than yesterday. I was never a voracious eater either way. Francisa bid her goodnight, thankfully bereft of any irritation over my tardiness. I still sat in the chair going through my new quests.

I glanced at the ring and wand I had kept from the tutorial, put beside the thoroughly cleaned and neatly folded robe.

'I wonder if there is another exit portal in the dungeon, like it was in the Tutorial? The storyline revolves around it a fair bit. Perhaps after we clear the levels, we can access it? How is it connected to this calamity though?'

I finally had some information on what the calamity was. Seemingly no one here had seen it, at least no one alive. The last person to have seen it and migrated to Alteraz died a few years ago. There was no shortage of stories, however. Common among them all were monsters - hordes upon hordes of unending waves of monsters. And that was just the beginning. The monsters in this world differed from normal creatures only by their vicious and bloodthirsty nature. "Normal" creatures were terrifying in their own right but usually got aggressive only for food, territory, or mate. As for monsters, aggressive was their default setting. 'Perhaps it is in their special effects?'

'Speaking of special effects, Divin mentioned some changes in Status. Let's see...' I got up from the chair and lay comfortably on the bed. Swiping a finger up brought my new stats up

'Woah! What is with these special effects? Huh... Mind control is a thing? Damn. Glad I'm immune.'

I was a bit disheartened that all the monsters I killed in level 20 gave me no experience at all. Still, my mood lightened with the new special effects.

'Francisa mentioned I'll be meeting the Royal Mages who drew the Circle tomorrow. Wonder what's in store? Not looking forward to the "parade" though. Ugh. Anyway, gonna get back in the grove come morn. So much to discover!'

I smiled. In a way, I was glad to be here. 'Magic and Code being the same are awesome!'

And so I slept fitfully, dreaming of Runes of flight and confetti.
