# Volume 2 - A Dying World

## Chapter 26 - Bootstrap

As the teleportation light faded from my vision, I immediately turned back. Half expecting a horde of nutty monsters, I breathed a sigh of relief when instead of monsters, I was surrounded by opulent NPCs. If the tropes were to be believed, it would be one king or another begging us to go fight a demon lord or some such.

I noticed the glow dimming from the circle of Runes beneath my feet. I discreetly aimed an Identify at the whole motif. A window of "Summoning Circle" appeared.

'Interesting... Runes are individual constructs, and multiple Runes can be connected to form a "Circle". Not unlike using singular functions in the main program. I will have to individually check each Rune later, perhaps it can help me in teleporting back home.'

I left it at that, deciding to inspect the NPCs instead. 'Here I thought my robes were high class. Their clothes make ours look like low-end casual wear.' And their clothes suited their alluring faces. All the men were statuesque, and women bewitching. Honestly, I was starting to feel a bit envious.

I felt one of them looking at me fixedly. She was right behind the one who I assumed was in charge. She quickly averted her eyes, a slight blush coloring her cheeks. 'Cute. Considering these are NPCs, the level of details is approaching creepy! If I was back home, I would not have been able to distinguish them from real humans.'

Soon, the NPC in charge walked forward. I hoped he won't drone on - I had no MP, barely any SP, and around a third of HP remaining.

"Heroes, welcome!" 'Oh, so we are heroes from the get-go then? That saves some trouble.'

"I am Siegfried Von Lohengramm, head of clan Lohengramm and current leader of the Clan Council." 'Clan Council? Not a King or an Emperor?'

He stopped for a breath, perhaps hoping his words held significance to us. I had no clue though. None of my companions spoke either.

"Please, do not worry, everyone here is an ally. These are my peers and fellow members of the Council. Our representatives will lead you to your rooms to take care of subsistence and repose." 'Oh, done already? Good.'

Thankfully, the guy ended his speech quickly. I bet he took pity on us. 'I ain't complaining, food and rest sound like heaven right now!'

As soon as he said that, a young girl NPC from the side latched onto Taro. Another guy came and conversed with Julie. I noticed some hesitation from the remaining two women when the other ran to Divin. The one who stared at me earlier walked towards me with a bland face.

"Greetings sir," she said - bending down and picking up her flowing gown slightly, "I'm princess Francisa Von Lohengramm, at your service. May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?"

'Oh... A princess NPC?' I was a bit surprised. I assumed we were summoned by a cult, given the introduction by "clan head", but there was actually a princess here. 'Another thing to investigate, if time permits.'

"I'm Pat. Nice to meet ya. Guess you're stuck with me, eh?" I joked, hoping to break the ice a bit.

She let her gown go and took an unwavering posture, giving off a smile that didn't reach her eyes. 'This is not _approaching_ creepy, it totally is. This NPC is giving me the stink-eye!'

"Oh no. It is an honor, sir... Pat. Please, follow me. I shall guide you to your room." she said coldly. 'Is this supposed to happen? Isn't the princess supposed to fawn over the heroes?'

I looked at our group. Taro was already being escorted off by the young girl... 'Princess', probably to his room. The rest, however, exchanged unspoken words with each glance. 'Looks safe, should follow the NPCs for now.'

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

'Ah, I had forgotten how good hot water feels against the skin! Especially when you are exhausted.'

Lazing about in the bath, I almost forgot that I was inside a simulation. The bath felt magical indeed, relieving the tension I did not know I held. As much as I would have liked to, however, I could not stay in there forever. Eventually, the water turned cold and I got out dripping the remnant drops on the marble floor. I wiped the moisture off and put on the loose clothes left by one of the maids. 'I wonder what's for dinner?' I hummed a merry tune as I got back into my room.

I slowly opened the door, then stopped right there, stunned for a moment at the sight. The princess NPC had changed clothes! Now wearing a silky black night-gown that barely reached her knees, she arranged the plates and laid some food for us both. My sight wandered over her body for quite a while, since she hadn't noticed me yet. Her attention was not on the task at hand, lost in her own world. I watched with silent mirth as a circus of emotions passed her beautiful face. A moment of apprehension, another of determination. A slight shame here, a bit of sadness there. Some excitement, some shyness. So much realism, that for a moment my mirth turned into pity. Her attire, behavior, sentiments - hell, her very presence left me in no doubt of her purpose here.

'Doesn't this part come later, typically at the end?'

And yet in the reversal of common lore, here stood this young woman, bare a couple of years younger than me. I did not know why she was doing this, but I was pretty sure she did not fall for me in the few minutes that we talked and walked. Whatever her circumstances were, I myself was a bit alarmed about the whole situation. It would've felt just right in a dream; in the real world (or as real as this simulation could get), I had other concerns. First, I had great reservations about such an obviously reluctant offer. Second, I doubted there was any protection method present. I did not want to catch anything nor leave anything behind. My decision made, I coughed lightly to bring her attention back from the clouds.

She looked up startled, almost dropping a dollop of porridge-like stuff on the table. 'Hmm... Even the reactions are exceptionally life-like. I wonder what manner of data-structures are driving these? There's surely an ML layer behind all this, perhaps even multiple pseudo-intelligent overseer AIs like Betty.'

I drove the thought of Betty out of my mind. 'This gorgeous NPC princess demands your focus right now!' I mentally reeled myself. I had to take care of how I interacted with them; for all I knew, my words and actions could also affect the main storyline like several other games from back home.

"Sir Pat, forgive my presumption. I was hoping to dine with you tonight if it so pleases you," she lay the spoon down and curtsied again. Given her awkward stance though, I realized it was more out of habit or nervousness than anything else. She flustered a bit, hands clutching air instead of non-existent skirts. I pretended at having not seen her dither, instead smiled and said, "Of course, it would be my honor to dine with you."

Saying so, I took my seat. I was pretty sure that I was being rude in some way. She gripped her length on her gown and pressed it downwards, hoping to cover her legs some more perhaps. Instead, the action emphasized another part, rather parts, of herself. Fiddly as can be, she dragged the chair back and sat herself down. 'Oh shoot, was I supposed to do that?'

I mentally kicked myself for missing that. My hunger soon brought my attention back to the plate though. Sure, I never starved in the Tutorial, but I had gone for a month without food. It had left a void in my heart. And stomach. The roasted chicken and mashed potatoes in butter were simply paradise. I left the supposed porridge aside - too sweet. Sips of wine instead? Just right.

We ate dinner in silence. I was indeed curious about many things, but it could wait. The food demanded and deserved my full attention. I did not know what the princess ate, or if she had at all, but she was done before I was. As I wiped my plate clean and gave a sigh of satisfaction with a rub over my tight belly, I felt sweet fatigue wash over me.

I excused myself from the table and went to wash off, assuming the maids would clean the table off later. 'The princess should get a clue with this.' I immediately jumped into bed and dragged the covers on my prone form. It was damn cold, and that was okay. It felt right somehow.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

My elation did not last for long. The maid did not come to clean up the table. Neither did the princess make herself scarce. No, she did the exact opposite. She slid herself under the covers.

I was flabbergasted. Never have I ever been in a situation where a pretty lady came on to me so strongly and I wanted nothing of it. Thankfully, she kept her hands to herself.

"S-Sir Pat, I..." she stuttered in a morose whisper. She jumped into my bed and _then_ got cold feet? NPC or not, I was starting to feel sympathy for her. I opened my eyes and looked into her deep blue ones. So caught in her melancholic beauty was I that for a moment I forgot to breathe. Only for a moment though, as I spoke up:

"I'm sorry, princess. I've been fighting monsters practically non-stop for a whole month. Normally, you would see me act very differently, so don't take this as a fault on your part. I am simply burned out and want to sleep." I said, hoping my words were kind yet firm. I saw a mixture of relief and disappointment on her face, quickly hidden behind a mask of understanding. 'Girl, make up your mind already. You are making _me_ feel indecisive, and I have already made my decision!'

"I understand. Please accept my apologies and forgive my forwardness!" she asserted, sliding out of the bed. "I shall come at sunrise tomorrow. I hope sir Pat has a restful night."

"Um... Yes. Goodnight." I felt a bit guilty about throwing her out. I wasn't kidding about the burn-out though, I was asleep within a minute after she was gone.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

I woke up just before dawn. The window was facing my bed, so the pre-dawn light made its way right onto my snoring face. I forcefully opened my eyes, as the sun peaked over the window-still, gathering my thoughts over the events of the previous day.

A light knock brought me out of my stupor. I removed the dirt from my eyes and sat up in bed. "Come on in!" I responded and in came the princess and a maid. The maid cleaned the tabled and left a jar of water there, moving on to draw a bath.

"Good morning, sir Pat!" the princess greeted. I could see her resolve remade, blue eyes bright like the sky outside was turning into. Even her dress was an odd mix of blue folds and pink frills. 'The nightgown suits her figure better,' I appraised thoughtfully.

"Morning, princess!" I greeted back. We tactfully skipped over last night's misadventures. "Here to have breakfast?" I asked.

"Yes, if sir Pat doesn't mind my company?" she said. I replied an affirmative and she signal another maid, who was presumably standing outside waiting for the order, to lay out the food.

I got out of the bed and drank deeply from the jar, making my way towards the toilet. Yes, with sleep and food, the other parts of my anatomy had kick-started as well. The toilet itself was, from a distance at least, no different than a modern western toilet. Get close and you'd notice that it was actually a proper chair with a hole in the center. Closer still and you'd notice all the Runes decorating it inside and out. I noticed at least three different disinfection Runes. Either way, I was thankful I did not have to go in a pot.

Soon after finishing my business, I made my way to the bath after the earlier maid vacated, just in time to see a Rune fizzle out. 'A temporary heat Rune? I've learned more about Runes in the last 24 hours than the entire previous month!' Cursing the futility of the Tutorial and not loitering long like last night, I quickly made my way towards breakfast, sitting in front of the beaming princess.

"I shall show sir Pat around the palace grounds after breakfast, then we shall attend to the throne room for lunch with the other heroes and clan heads," she laid out my agenda like it was natural, "if sir Pat obliges, I would like to give a small tour of the noble quarters in the evening as well." I wondered how the nights of the rest of my fellow test-subjects had been. 'Guess we'll talk at lunch directly.'

"Sounds like a plan. And, uh, call me Pat. Just Pat." I chuckled. Mixing "sir" with my nickname and coming out the mouth of a princess felt quite odd.

"If it pleases you si- Pat. I would appreciate it if you called me Francisa as well," she grinned back.

"Will do, Francisa. So, I was wondering, and do forgive me if I offend in some way, but you are a princess, right? Are there kings and queens as well? How do the clan and their head factor in the hierarchy?" I questioned after chewing a mouthful of fresh bread.

She looked up at me from her own loaf, collecting her thoughts. I could feel her getting ready for a lecture. "Our ancestors were actually the ones who were kings and queens. Clan Lohengramm had a kingdom once, back when my grandfather was but a child. Circumstances, however, forced us to gather here. All the families you met yesterday were of royal blood, but none of our kingdoms exist anymore. Nor do we have space or resources to form any on this continent. Hence, we formed a new way of governance. Royal families became clans, and we rule this part of the human lands with the Clan Council, a congregation of former royals. Being called princess is just a vestige of lost time."

I wonder what these "circumstances" actually were. I was torn between my brain insisting that these "people" weren't truly real and my heart tugging at the extremely vivid depiction of sadness that veiled this pretty girl's face. I slapped myself mentally - 'the princess was monologuing her clan's story and current affairs, I should be paying attention.' I was hanging on to her every word, unwilling to miss even the slightest detail.

And so our breakfast continued, merrily discussing seemingly trite matters, the dark memories of last night's incident long forgotten.

## Chapter 27 - Lay of Land

Breakfast was normal. Strips of crisp bacon, a couple of eggs, some brown bread, and another sweet drink.

Feeling my trouser tighten a bit around my waist, I called it quits. The princess did eat, after all, but in small bits held in dainty hands with quick moves that were quite hard to notice. When you did notice it, there was an indisputable grace to the motion; having the effect of making me feel like a brute. Not that she mentioned it.

After the hearty breakfast, she led me to the gardens on the backside of the Palace. Well, calling them gardens was a bit of an understatement - they felt more like an environmental landscape artist decided to go crazy on experimentation.

The "front" gardens were more for showing off, and for having large areas for parties and events. The "back" gardens, where I was currently examining what looked like a pink daffodil, were for private conversations and relaxing.

Sitting under the shade of an awning and nursing another sweet drink in her hand, the princess was currently expanding my knowledge on local geography.

"... And so, this is both a frontier and last line of defense for humanity. My great-grandfather - honored King Alexander Von Lohengramm, noticed the signs of creeping calamity long before other nations. Thus, he began the colonization of this continent of Alteraz. Eventually, the kingdom could not hold out any longer, so he sent my grandfather, then merely 19 years of age, to continue the line here while he himself stayed back. Many nobles of our kingdom followed his example, sending their sons and daughters along with my grandfather to the new lands," she took a sip before continuing, "of course, there was the prophecy as well, it pointed to a dungeon here. Alteraz is where the heroes shall defeat the calamity and the world will be safe once again!"

'Did she just casually mention a dungeon?' Before I could interrupt, she pushed on. When it comes to talking about her family history, she just kept going on and on.

"And so, my grandfather formed an alliance with four other clans. They weren't more than bridgeheads back then, but now the former alliance rules as the five major clans. The clan system was actually formalized by my father himself! And my big brother was -" she stopped, slight shock apparent on her face. I remember her mentioning her little brother, this was the first time I heard about a big brother. I gave her a moment, as she hesitated. She spoke in a small voice, "Big brother was supposed to be the first official overseer."

Her fingers trembled slightly. Moisture clouded her eyes. 'Why is this cut scene making my heart squidge?'

After a practiced deep breath, a mournful smile decorated her features. "He was last seen on the wrong side of the high passes," she spoke with fool's hope. After a minute of silence, she pronounced, "Oh! Look at me, rambling on. The Sun is almost past the zenith, perhaps we should head inside for the luncheon?"

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

In the several hours since breakfast till noon, I got a crash course on the surrounding terrain, historical intrigues, and the current political situation of this continent named Alteraz.

This continent was also supposedly the only inhabitable one left. Others were taken over by the calamity. I was still unclear on exactly what it was.

So, the disaster started off on the other side of the planet, slowly covering a larger area with time. All the sapient species, at least those that could traverse the oceans, sailed ahead of it. Eventually ending up gathering here. Even I could imagine the chaos this would imply.

The native inhabitants of this region - the eastern part of the continent, were goblins and beast tribes of diverse species. Goblins had been wiped out a few years before Francisa was born. By the time she celebrated her tenth birthday, a majority of the beast tribes had been subjugated. The annexation of Centaur lands was currently underway. There was also an incursion of faeries back when humans initially marched in when they overran the southern forests, but not much is known about their whereabouts now.

The central area was littered with high mountains. An entire mountain range split the continent in two. I imagined this was probably due to there being two different continents that collied into one. Not unlike the Himalayas when India bumped into Asia.

In any case, the highest mountains graced the northernmost parts and were occupied by, unsurprisingly, the Dragons. There were large sub-terrain worms that dug in a little south. The central area was taken in by Dwarves. Well, the central area deep inside the mountains at least, perhaps even below sea level. Further south were the caves of Drows. There was a large forested area to the south that covered a better part of the mountains and flowed on either side of it.

Also somewhere high up in the mountains, near the Dwarven territory, were the "high passes" that humans held. This place was a window to the other side of the continent. On the other side, there were reports of Elven constructs and Orcish hordes. Not much was known beyond that.

Of course, these were only some of the major players on the continent. "Civilized" people, so to speak. Innumerable creatures roamed the vast "uncivilized" areas that were being quickly engulfed by the former. I learned that the mammoths, crocs, and squid-face went extinct hundreds of years ago. Panthers still resided in the south. About the rest of the creatures, they were either common or unknown. Quite a dichotomy.

An optimistic estimate was that humans currently reigned supreme in the eastern continent - bar the "uncivilized" regions as it were.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Closer to home, there were about thirteen clans spread out all over the human-occupied lands ranging from the eastern coast to central mountains. Five were considered as major clans, the ones from the original invasion alliance. They were also closer to the center. Apparently, I was one clan's area away from the mountains - one could see them if they go to the front gardens. The rest were under the oversight of these five clans in one way or another.

This was a very new system of governance, not even two generations old. And so there were the typical ones who wanted to rise above others, others who sought to pull the former down. There were even such forces among the major clans. Francisa all but mentioned that her brother was a victim to these political plays and not the minacious posting at the border.

All that was about the nobles. The commoners, instead, played a different game. Needless to say, petty criminals were commonplace. Serious crimes were widespread as well. But these things were par for the course. What concerned Francisa the most, and by that I mean her father - I doubt she was viewing the situation from her own perspective, was the new church of convulsion. This church believed that the ongoing cataclysm was a sign from the gods. Their gospel was that humans should fight the monster hordes that heralded the disaster, allying instead of conquering other sapient species. The more radical members of the church were convinced that the world was going to end because the humans had strayed from the righteous path and this was their just reward. It was funny how even NPC humans were inclined to consider themselves the center of everything - even a catastrophe. The problem arose, however, when one of their core beliefs was that heroes were against the natural order of things, the belief that had led to numerous troubles so far. Indeed, hearing about their exploits made me re-imagine them more as an assassin's guild than a godly church.

Such was the situation where I was summoned into - war on all fronts, people tearing each other's throats out, and an inevitable doom closing in on us. This world was fucked to hell and back!

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

I arrived at the summoning hall following Francisa, which was being doubled as a throne room and dining hall. 'Shit, they scrubbed the Runes!'

I nodded at the NPCs and smiled at my companions, of whom everyone but Taro was already present. Julie sent a weary smile back. Carol seemed amused by something. Divin nodded back without a smile. Arya was fuming. I took a seat amidst them, all of us seating on one side of the table. Francisa took the seat facing me on the other side. Apparently, each of the representatives had taken a seat in front of their partners.

The prince NPCs ahead of Carol and Arya sat in a rigid posture, staring at the table with expressionless eyes and stony faces. The one in front of Julie instead had a natural serious expression one would expect as such an occasion. The princess with Divin sat with a finger on her chin, eyes far away in thought.

I sat beside Carol, who immediately leaned over and whispered, "Didja, ya know...?" and glanced at Francisa.

"Naw... I'm not that stupid ya know." I retorted. She raised her hand in mock apology, saying something about men and their thinking.

It was at that moment that Taro strolled in. With the remaining princess in tow. Clinging on to each other like newlyweds. 'Damn it, they got him. Hook, line and sinker!'

Carol flashed a victorious smirk at me. I scowled back, 'His actions have no bearing on the reasoning of all men.' Her smug expression persisted, however.

Lunch was a somber affair. Besides the tasty food of course. Earlier, Francisa bemoaned never having had a full royal course that her grandfather boasted of. Food was scarce here. Yet tasteful enough for my palate. No, the somberness came from the NPCs! Especially the representatives. From the look of things, only the youngest princess had succeeded in their shared mission.

"Ahm..." the clan head stood up and cleared his throat. 'Man, at least let me enjoy my dessert first!' Uncaring of my mental protests, he continued - "Again, I would like to welcome you all. I hope our hospitality wasn't too lacking." He looked over us, pausing slightly longer on the taut princes. "As you all must have surmised, our world is currently facing a great tribulation, one which we yearn to repatriate with your fortunate aid. The Council proposed to have one clan take in one hero each to prepare you for the preordained animus." 'Does this guy walk around with a hidden dictionary or something?' "And yet, some unforeseen events have caused us to reassess our adjudication." 'Hmm? _What_ is this about?' "As such, Sir Pat, Lady Arya, and Lady Carol shall continue to dwell in our royal quarters. Sir Divin, Lady Julie, and Sir Taro have preferred to follow their representatives to respective clans for further tutelage." '_Whaaaa...?_ When did these guys decide everything?' Julie shot me an apologetic glance. Divin was stoic as usual. Taro was... Best not spoken about right now.

I barely had a chance to process this news. The leader, however, steamrolled onward. "Nevertheless, fret not over what may come. For today is a day of convalescence. The three departing heroes shall leave tomorrow afternoon, but not before a grand parade to reassure the populace!" He beamed at us; was he expecting excited "whoo" perhaps? All he got in return were affirmative grunts from Divin and Julie. I was stumped still - 'We are disbanding our party? Is it temporary then, just for training? What _does_ he mean by training though?' A thousand thoughts whirled in my head, the cold dessert in front of me left untouched.

## Chapter 28 - A Hero's Welcome (1)

"So you're leaving then?" (Me, to Julie)

"Yes. Johnathan told me about his clan - they are sort of experts in the outdoorsy things. Training at their place would prove beneficial to me as an Archer." (Julie explained)

"What about their plans for us later?" (Divin questioned)

"What are you talking about?" (Taro, doubtful)

"I talked with my representative, Anna. I got the feeling that once this calamity is over, these clans intend to retake their homelands. And they want us by their side. Having a hero to reclaim their lands will give any clan quite an edge over others." (Divin)

'Oh, so that was why...' (Me, connecting the dots)

"I don't know. It's too far off in the future." (Julie, now turning to Carol) "Carol, you should rethink your plan and join me for training."

"Nae, I told ye before. I'll be fine 'ere with Pat and Arya." (Carol)

"I'm afraid I am out of the loop. Why are we suddenly splitting up for training?" (Me, glancing about)

"Well, it's no surprise you don't know about the split. They presumed you would stay here in the first place. Anyhow, your princess should have explained the training part at least - see, our attributes increase not only by level-ups but also by exercising our skills. And these skills are a double-edged sword, for that matter. Like my True Shot skill - it doesn't matter if I can shoot a homing arrow if I misjudge the distance from my target; or worse, simply freeze during combat. This stuff needs getting used to, hence the training." (Julie)

"I see. No, she probably missed it. And she's not _my_ princess. We just talked about geography and current affairs the most, with bits of history and politics." (Me, frowning) 'And near entirety of Lohengramm family past.'

"Seems our next Class Upgrade will be somewhat special." (Divin, changing topics)

"Oh, how so?" (Taro, distracted)

"I'm not sure. They will tell us before starting our training, I suppose. Does anyone else have any info?" (Divin, looking around)

"Nah, I don't think so. By the way, what's up with you Arya? Been quiet a lot." (Me, glancing at Arya, noticing sympathetic looks from Julie and Carol)

"Um, sorry was just lost in thought." (Arya)

"'Twas that goon prince, bloody minger." (Carol, bursting out) "He was quite insistent on Arya last night. I saw 'em scurry off after lunch."

"What happened?" (Divin, severely)

"Nothing! It wasn't as bad as Carol made it sound. I'm slightly astounded, is all." (Arya, smiling slightly)

'Ah, I guess the courting manners of medieval princes do not suit the sensibilities of modern women. Heh.'

The conversation died down after that. Taro was fiddling with something in his hands. His grin from earlier today returned full force.

"A-Ano... I've got this... Thing. Yeah. S-So, I'll see ya later." (Taro, almost jogging off)

No prize for guessing his destination. The rest looked on with complicated expressions. 'Let him have his fun, he'll be alright. Hopefully.'

"So, what happens when this simulation is over?" (Arya)

"What do you mean?" (Divin)

"I mean... Will we be spending the rest of our lives here? Or will it end at some definite point? Will we be back as we were before, or will the time we spend here will be gone forever? All I know is that time here goes faster than Earth. What do you think Pat?" (Arya)

"Well, the test _has_ to end at some point, else there won't be any point of it. And I think it will end after we defeat this world-ending threat. Also, even if we grow gray-haired by that point, we should still end up back home as we were when we first entered." (Me)

"How did you come to these conclusions?" (Divin, with the rest listening in rapt attention)

"Hmm, this whole setup feels like a video game to me. And games end when you defeat the final boss. As for our time spent here, I think we aren't actually here physically. Simply because the Simulation itself is virtual. We are something like game characters or avatars, just based on our exact physical appearances. That is what I think, in theory." (Me)

'At least I hope so. We could just as well be copies of our original consciousness to be discarded after the test is finished.'

"Do you think we will remember all this?" (Julie, after considering my words)

"I can't say for sure but, when a test ends, you revert the system to its original state. All the effects are temporary. And given what we've been through, I don't think memory alteration is a big deal to these guys. So, yeah..." (Me)

'Time dilation and memory modification - the perfect recipe for conducting tests on unsuspecting subjects. I bet they've been at this for a considerable time, who knows how many hapless poor sods were experimented upon beside us?'

"So, them new special effects? They're quite swick eh? And these people, are they real or what?" (Carol)

'What? I have not opened my status since coming here. Need to check up on a lot of things.'

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Our after-lunch soirée lasted for a while. It was just us "heroes" gathered in the back gardens. Sans Taro.

The NPCs planned to have one hero attach to one clan. That clan would take responsibility for training the hero. All five major clans were in, of course. The sixth clan, where Julie was headed, was admitted out of necessity. Either way, not one day in and we'd already upended the storyline.

Arya decided to stay at the palace. Carol opted to stay with her as well. Neither had warmed up to their prince. The girls had decided this together last night sometime. Divin presumed everyone was splitting up so he planned to go out as well. After hearing that he could've refused, he made a sour face for a while. As for the former two, Arya was getting help from the Lohengramm clan like myself. She had refused all support from the assigned representative clan. Carol instead was having her "tutor" coming over. As for me? I would have to check things out with Francisa later.

Regarding our Classes, while we _were_ at the baseline, it was merely the lowest standard required to get official jobs out here. People started their leveling as young as 6 years old. By the time they grew up to 15 years, they comfortably reached level 20. A human was considered an adult at that point. Some leveled up earlier, some later in the age bracket of 13 to 19.

The fun began beyond this milestone. People take up jobs befitting their Class, usually under a mentor. What they do with their mastery of Base Classes ends up affecting the next Class Upgrade. A Craftsman who takes up farming gets a Farmer Class. A Healer who joins the clergy and starts preaching gets a priest-like Class. And there is no limit on the variety of Classes one could achieve depending on the jobs they take. Assuming they are in their evolutionary tree, of course. A Scout would end up as a very poor stable-boy if he even gets that Class. As far as Julie knew, and she was the one who knew the most in this area, the Craftsman Class had the most known branches and the Mage class had the least.

We continued sharing the knowledge we had gleaned from our NPC counterparts. I expounded on the war with Centaurs and the situation in high passes. Divin was more concerned about what the NPCs expected of us, cautioning against making ill-advised agreements and taking thoughtless actions. He feared altering the storyline too much; we might cut ourselves off from achieving the end goal.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

The shadows lengthened as the sky turned orange. For a while, I imagined myself back in the Tutorial. A flash of light burst from the side. 'Betty?' All of us immediately glanced at the spherical source.

Similar bursts happened at regular distances all across the garden. "Magical Lights," Divin explained quietly.

I calmed myself. 'Getting worked up over nothing.' Besides, it was quite late. I remembered Princess had some plans for the eve. I added, "Check Magical Lights" to my quest list.

Eventually, we broke off, planning to meet again tomorrow to discuss and work out future arrangements. I arrived at my room, not surprised to see Francisa already waiting, with a badly-concealed pout.

"Greetings, _Sir_ Pat." 'Ah. Here we go.'

"Hello there Francisa. Sorry, I'm a bit late; our meeting went off the rails there a bit." 'That should do it?'

"I understand. Do forgive me though, the tea has gone cold. The cakes are still edible though." She declared, proffering the sweets on the table. "I had offered to acquaint a few of my friends to Sir Pat. Shall we move it to tomorrow evening?"

"Of course. I'll be happy to meet your friends." 'No need to antagonize her further.' I took a piece of the spongy cake with a fork and placed it in my mouth, sitting down in front of her. "The cake's nice!" I idly commented.

"I'm sure Anna would've appreciated your words. She'll be departing tomorrow with Sir Divin, however. Though, Hamilton will be glad to convene." She mused.

"Hmm... So Francisa, about the dungeon you mentioned..." I shot off one question after another, which she answered promptly and precisely. Francisa was quite the conversationalist once you got her going. Her formality dropped to yesterday's favorable milieu as our discussion continued. We talked at length about prophecies, monsters, magic, and of all things, civil duty and filial responsibilities, among other topics fantastical and mundane.

Soon, the Sun dipped below the horizon. I failed to notice it last night, but now I realized that instead of candles, the maids had placed magical sticks in the corner. It had Runes! And obviously, I amended my earlier to-do. Along with the magical candle came tonight's dinner, again in the company of the princess. And again I stuffed myself, just slightly lesser than yesterday. I was never a voracious eater either way. Francisa bid her goodnight, thankfully bereft of any irritation over my tardiness. I still sat in the chair going through my new quests.

I glanced at the ring and wand I had kept from the tutorial, set beside the thoroughly cleaned and neatly folded robe.

'I wonder if there is another exit portal in the dungeon, like it was in the Tutorial? The storyline revolves around it a fair bit. Perhaps after we clear the levels, we can access it? How is it connected to this calamity though?'

I finally had some information on what the calamity was. Seemingly no one here had seen it, at least no one alive. The last person to have seen it and migrated to Alteraz died a few years ago. There was no shortage of stories, however. Common among them all were monsters - hordes upon hordes of unending waves of monsters. And that was just the beginning. The monsters in this world differed from normal creatures only by their vicious and bloodthirsty nature. "Normal" creatures were terrifying in their own right but usually got aggressive only for food, territory, or mate. As for monsters, aggressive was their default setting. 'Perhaps it is in their special effects?'

'Speaking of special effects, Divin mentioned some changes in Status. Let's see...' I got up from the chair and lay comfortably on the bed. Swiping a finger up brought my new stats up

---

'Woah! What is with these special effects? Huh... Mind control is a thing? Damn. Glad I'm immune.'

I was a bit disheartened that all the monsters I killed in level 20 gave me no experience at all. Still, my mood lightened with the new special effects.

'Francisa mentioned I'll be meeting the Royal Mages who drew the Circle tomorrow. Wonder what's in store? Not looking forward to the "parade" though. Ugh. Anyway, gonna get back in the grove come morn. So much to discover!'

I smiled. In a way, I was glad to be here. 'Magic and Code being the same are awesome!'

And so I slept fitfully, dreaming of Runes of flight and confetti.

## Chapter 29 - A Hero's Welcome (2)

The usual glare of the dawning sun woke me from my slumber. It was getting old fast. 'Just five more minutes please!'

It was not to be. I faced the other side in protest, yet hardly a wink passed and I heard a knock.

I hate waking up from deep sleep. Half the time, I get mild headaches when it happens. As if my body itself is naturally resistant to waking up early. Today was not one of those days, thankfully. I did not want to be annoying first thing in the morning at Francisa. Still, I wasn't in the best of moods.

"Come on in!" I grunted. It wasn't Francisa who greeted me, however. Just the maid, who curtsied and nonchalantly deposited a jar of water on the table and went to draw the bath.

I did the necessities, coming out of the bath a while later with my Tutorial robe on, my mood markedly improved. The breakfast was laid on the table, with a beaming princess on the side.

"Today is a fine day, isn't it Sir Pat?" she uttered, caressing out non-existent wrinkles on her expensive purple-hued dress. This was the same variant of the one she wore when we first met. An "important event" NPC costume, I figured.

"Yep. You're looking quite nice in the dress." I casually complimented and sat down. "And please Francisa, just call me Pat." A maid hovered by to drop dollops of orangish stuff into my plate. And some bread. These guys love their bread.

"T-thanks, Sir Pat. I mean, Pat." She blushed a little. 'Cute.' "Ah, my apologies. It would get some getting used to. Please try the bhuna pumpkin sauce, it's a specialty where we come from. Or rather, used to be." She tapered into silence at the end but perked up again by proclaiming my tasks for today. "Today we'll be going around the Noble quarters and the town square in commoner's district in the ceremonial chaises. Hero and their representatives in each one. Hopefully, we'll be back by lunch, where we will meet Hamilton, my dear friend. The evening will be taken up for your discourse with the Royal Mages. They shall lay out your tutelage for the coming weeks. I shall attend to you whenever I can, of course."

I just nodded, quietly savoring the bitter-sweet taste of the orange sauce, a bit overwhelmed by the extreme emotional swings of this NPC. The only thing missing in my opinion was a steaming cup of joe. I didn't even mind having the bread again, soft and freshly baked out of the oven. The day was getting better with the minute.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

We gathered into the main hall - the one that had doubled as a throne room, a dining hall, and a summoning room so far.

'This is it!' Today, I was actually venturing out beyond the safe zone. A whole new world and all I'd seen were a couple of rooms and a backyard. Sure, being gawked at by the masses sucked the fun out a bit, but I was excited to step out nonetheless. 'What sort of wonders shall I see today?'

Each "hero" - 'Heh.' I still chuckled at that - was standing beside their representative and a couple of Royal Guards. The guards did not have shining armor or magic swords. Instead, they carried spears and round shields like aspis, reminding me of Spartan Hoplites. They did look stone-cold deadly.

Divin and Anna were having a whispered conversation. Not romantic. No. More like mafiosos discussing an underground business deal. Taro, still grinning but with bags under his eyes, had the other princess clutching his arm like a vise. 'What had Francisa called her? Prissy?'

Carol still had her representative beside her, but the wide distance between them left no one in doubt about their relationship. Arya was with a little kid that had the same sky blue eyes and dirty blond hair as Francisa. 'Her little brother?'

Julie was having an animated conversation with Johnathan. 'The guy could do to loosen up a bit.' And finally, little old me with my - err, not actually mine - princess, who was going on about the importance of soon-to-be-held "parade" in calming the people down. I nodded and hummed where necessary, but the words filtered in one ear and went right out the other.

We weren't standing close enough to speak with each other, so I simply smiled and mouthed a "hey" when our eyes met. Divin gave a barely perceptible nod. Taro half-waved with his free hand. Carol smiled and returned an energetic wave. 'She is probably the most excited of us all about this.' Arya was staring at the still-chatting princess by my side, missing my signal entirely. Julie gave a firm nod back. We had planned to meet today sometime, but never decided on the time. 'Perhaps after lunch?'

My thoughts were interrupted by another cutscene. The main clan leader NPC stood up and began another speech of gratitude and co-operation with suitably pompous words. With that, we stepped out the large doors of the hall out into the sunlight.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Another garden. For a while, I had forgotten about the front gardens. These were spread over a wide area, however, and a majority of that area was taken by nicely trimmed grass. Sporadically planted were some sort of short trees with white trunks and round tops. My attention was snatched up by the small open-topped carriages - carriages whose decorations had decorations. I was loath to even be seen near such gaudy creations, but I suppose it was too late to present my suggestions.

We went ahead and climbed upon the aberrations. Not forgetting my chivalry this time around, I extended a hand to Francisa. NPC or not, her surprise and the eventual flush was worth the effort. I did let go of the hand after she climbed up though. 'Was she trying to hold on?' Perhaps it was just my imagination.

The chariots began with a start. The horse bound on mine was a black shiny thing, brushed to high heavens. The lead carriage had the clan leader and his wife. Us test subjects followed. In the rear was another chariot with a Royal Mage and an Archer on board.

Our procession went through the gardens and out onto a dirt road. It was pressed flat and had a smooth asphalt-like surface though, probably done so using magic. The road widened out as we went further when we finally came across something resembling a city.

Apparently, the palace was at the center of this city. It was surrounded by the Noble quarters on all sides. The Noble quarters, as it turned out, was a bunch of spaced-out buildings that looked like they were made of granite. A closer look revealed everything to be made of some dark smooth stone. Tuning in to radio-Francisa revealed why.

"...And so they had to build everything up in a hurry at first. Never knew when the goblins would attack. But later on, we employed Stone Masons, Earth Mages, High Enchanters, and so on to construct solid buildings out of compressed stone blocks and enchanted binding agents. The plan was to convert the whole city, but resources dwindled out soon enough..."

'Yes, just when the people with deep pockets had their homes sorted out, the resources "dwindled"!' I almost snorted.

Francisa stopped talking then, as we sighted a bunch of NPCs hanging out in their balconies, wearing their "important event" costumes and waving bright colorful clothes at us. The procession stopped here for a bit, some heavy words filtering back from the front-most carriage. A bit of cheering followed and we moved on. I saw a little boy waving a green cloth with all his might, screaming something unintelligible at me. My lips curled up on their own and my hand followed. I waved. Francisa smirked. 'Oh no!'

From then on, I had to wave at every bloody Tom, Dick, and Harry. 'You brought this on yourself. Now, you gotta suck it up and just smile & wave boy!'

We circled around the quarters, stopping every now and then. Soon, we left the magically constructed road and went on an actual dirt road. One with a generous helping of potholes and crevices. Thankfully, the carriages had pretty good suspension. I had a sneaking feeling that some magic was involved. More Runes, perhaps. I couldn't peek under the plentiful decorative coverings, however. 'I guess they are meant to hide as much as attract. Clever.'

Expansive stone houses gave way to shoddy wooden constructs. Eventually, we happened upon a clearing where many an enterprising merchant laid their wares. The NPC crowd here was not wearing their "important event" dresses. I wondered if they even owned any. Many looked on in surprise and wariness as the guards cleared some space near the center. The leader spoke some words up ahead and there was some slight cheering. Then we were asked to alight our carriages and gather around.

"Dear heroes!" NPC pseudo-king announced, "This is where we must part ways." 'Um... What?'

"Sir Divin, Sir Taro, Lady Julie. Representative clan carriages await your presence at the edge of this town, just a bit further. Bereave not your parting, for we shall foregather soon enough!" 'Goddamn it! Stupid fucking storyline.'

I was grouchy. I wanted to plan ahead. To make sure we exchanged information regularly. Hell, even devise a _means_ to exchange said information and generally keep in touch. I didn't know if I could exit on my own.

"Guess this is it, huh? Wish we had discussed stuff some more." Julie said. "We will meet again as soon as we reach the required level to go out on our own," Divin commented. "Yeah. Time will fly away, you'll see." Taro chipped in.

We said our goodbyes and swore to meet up again. Their carriages went ahead. We turned around, heading in the opposite direction - back the way we came. Francisa stayed quiet the whole way. Perhaps she sensed my crummy mood.

While I had known these guys for less than a month, we had come from the same place and overcame our trials together. I was slightly bitter at the separation, however temporary or necessary it was supposed to be. Maybe I had come to depend on them a little, or even feel a bit comfortable knowing they were around. 'I guess I should be happy that at least Carol and Arya are around.'

We made our trip back in silence, followed the same route back. The same people cheered for us again, with equal enthusiasm. Without stooping, we converged on the palace soon enough. Francisa promised to drop by during lunch and hopped off. Inside the hall, I talked with Arya and Carol, planning to meet again after lunch and get our headings. I went into my room and plopped into the bed. Even just smiling and waving can get mighty tiring.

## Chapter 30 - A Hero's Welcome (3)

"Sir Pat...SIR PAT...!" A faint but persistent voice assaulted my senses. "Um... Five more min-"

A gentle hand caressed my shoulder and THAT jolted me awake. I wasn't used to such mellow wake-up calls - the alarm on my phone blaring out being the usual deal.

I opened a bleary eye and noticed Francisa, in yet another costume. Greenish, less ceremonial, and far too frilly for my tastes.

"Have you rested well? Do forgive me, but it _is_ time for the luncheon, Sir Pat." She spoke softly.

'Damn, when did I fall asleep?' I sat up. 'Ah, she was bringing a friend along. Almost forgot with all that went down in the morning.'

"Yeah, I did. Must've been more tired than expected. No need to apologize." I smiled at Francisa.

"I understand, Pat. All that waving around must've been exhausting indeed." She smirked. 'Was she always this sassy?'

I snorted and went to wash my face. She called for a maid, who immediately rolled in a trolley of delicious smelling food and started laying out plates on the table.

"Today might be your last day of leisure Pat," Francisa called out as soon as I stepped back into the room. "After all, you will start training from tomorrow. Though it should be more of a lecture than an exercise in your case."

"Right." 'Guess my stamina won't be impressing anyone soon' "When is your friend coming over?"

"Oh, he's already in the palace. Right now he is greeting my lord father. Should be here presently." She was absentmindedly caressing one of her frills watching the maid finish up her work.

'I wonder how this new NPC will be like. Heh. I never thought I would say this but these characters are a bit too realistic. What was his name again?'

Just as the maid retreated into her corner, there was a knock on the door. 'Speak of the devil!'

"Enter." Francisa intoned. A tall man with a broad physique and a sunny smile pushed the door open. He carried himself with a lazy grace on heavy footsteps. Dark brown hair that ended in curls sat neatly on his head. And his light brown eyes danced with easy mirth. They lit up on seeing Francisa, who had walked ahead to meet him. They hugged each other lightly and then he stood beside her staring at the crimson patterns on my robe.

"Ahem. Sir Pat, this is my dear friend. Shield-Knight Hamilton." Francisa introduced him, then turned to him with a respectful gesture in my direction. "And gracing us for lunch today with his presence is the Hero-Mage Sir Pat."

"It is an honor, Sir Pat." His eyes turned somber and then he gave a deep bow that, despite his bulky frame, was balletic.

I nodded. 'Damn it this is awkward. Do I have to bow as well? Nah, I'll only end up making a fool of myself.' "It's nice to meet you as well, Hamilton." 'I don't think I'll forget his name again, now that I heard it clearly.'

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Hamilton was the most chill NPC I had encountered so far.

Once we got over the initial meeting ice-breakers, we had a lovely lunch. The food was awesome as usual. Hamilton soon loosened himself, starting to lightly tease Francisa. I joined in as well later, adding a few jabs of my own, leaving her red in the face.

He was easy to talk to. He never once said any words that had me wishing for a dictionary like NPC clan head. Nor did he ramble on and on like Francisa tended to do oftentimes. A jape here, an anecdote there, the guy was overall quite convivial. Even Francisa was enjoying herself.

Soon though, the lunch was over. We said our goodbyes. Hamilton offered to show me around the Knight training ground when time allowed. "I shall escort Hamilton outside. Please take some time to yourself, Pat. I shall arrive in the early evening for our assembly with the Royal Mages." Francisa said and strutted off, leaving the maid with the cleanup duty.

This was the same NPC who had been attending my room for the last couple of days. Average face, slightly tanned skin, dark hair tied in a loose bun. "Hey, need a hand?" I offered.

She seized up, jerking her face upward and looking at me with wide eyes. "N-No Sire, please. I-I got this." She stuttered.

"Um... Okay then. I'm gonna get some rest-" 'No, have to meet with Arya and Carol.' "Actually, I'm gonna head out for a bit. Thanks for cleaning up." I beamed and headed off. I was in a good mood as well.

The good mood did not last long. The shade in the garden did little to ward against the heat rolling off in waves from the blazing afternoon sun. Even examining the light Rune on magic lamps got dull in a while. After thirty more minutes of waiting, the sweat had formed a full layer between my skin and the robe. I felt myself losing SP just sitting there. 'Where the hell are they?'

I wish I had my phone with me. I would've called them ten times by now. Eventually, I gave up and trudged back to my room. Thankfully, it was somewhat cooler inside. 'I'll look for them later.' My legs found their way towards the bed, and for the second time that day, sweet slumber stole me like a master thief.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

The sun had gone down considerably when I woke up next. I sat up on the bed, contemplating the lengthening shadows.

For a moment, I wondered what my folks were up to again. 'Probably sleeping. And will keep sleeping while you waste time here.' I had no "better half" to worry about, haven't had since recently. 'Man, don't think about her again.' I mentally chastised then consoled myself. 'You have literal princesses jumping into your bed now!'. Then I chuckled, imagining what some of my friends from back home would've done in my situation. 'Home, eh?'

I had assumed I'd find some way to exit soon after leaving the tutorial. Sure, it was just day 2 here, but it wouldn't be as "soon" as I thought it to be. In fact, I was at a dead-end on that front.

The storyline offered so far was the generic "hero save world" crap. I had hoped to avoid it entirely if the path to exit was clear. Now? I wasn't sure if I could escape even after saving the world, despite my assurances to others.

One thing was apparent - I lacked information. About magic and how it interacted with this world. 'Yes, this ain't a sprint no more. Think marathon.' I gathered my resolve, taking a deep breath to calm my unsettled nerves. Getting sentimental won't help anymore. That was easier said than done though, given I had lingered among strange people and stranger lands for a better part of a month. Against my wishes, that too. True, I liked to travel as much as the next guy, but this unexpected vacation had thrown me into disarray. Just as a weight threatened to squeeze my heart, a soft knock rang out in the suddenly stifling room, bringing me out of my stupor. "Sir Pat? Are you awake?"

I took a deep breath again, finally managing to shake off whatever melancholy had crept upon me. "Yep. Come on in!" I shouted, faking a smile.

"I see you're awake this time." Francisa's eyes twinkled.

'This girl!' "Were you hoping for another chance to grope me?" I smirked back.

"G-Grope? I was merely hoping to awaken you. I scarcely t-touched your shoulder." She panicked a little, a rush of red coloring her cheeks and ears.

"Sureee." I drawled, lips stretched in a smug smile.

She caught on before I could tease further though, smirk replaced by a business smile. Back to serious mode. "Royal Archmage Kazif Arkanis will be meeting us in the mages' tower." She spoke. "He is the current captain of Royal Mages squadron and also in charge of Lohengramm Mage Tower." 'Do I notice a slight disdain in her tone?' "He will arrange for your tutelage."

"I see. He's the one teaching me?" I questioned.

"No, he will only confirm your Status, then assign mentors and necessary resources for you."

"Hmm. I should go wash my face again. When is the meeting?"

"The audience is in a while, but we shall present ourselves there soon and wait inside anyway." She said with a thoughtful look on her face, which then turned back into her earlier smirk "And yes, you _should_ wash your face. Your luck stat must be in excess; after all, you have acquired a wrinkle-immune robe to sleep in, a deed you seem quite fond of performing often."

"Heh." I had no retort to that but a light chuckle. And the robe _was_ quite comfy. Being free of wrinkles was a secondary concern to me.

"Oh, by the way, Lady Arya and Lady Carol wish to speak with you tomorrow. You all shall have breakfast together. I was given to understand that you missed your concourse today due to a mismatch in luncheon timings." 'Well, that is one mystery solved."

Wondering if luck attribute actually existed, I headed out with the princess in tow.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

The mage "tower" was a three-story high round structure made of similar compressed stone as the palace. More broad than high, we headed towards one of the four entrances - one in each cardinal direction, according to the princess. I was a bit disappointed with the distinctly non-magical and unimpressive architecture but then again, I should have expected it. These people are essentially third-generation refugees. The Sun was kissing the horizon behind the tower, turning it into a shadowy featureless giant to my eyes.

Soon we reached the eastern entrance. A large polished door adorned the otherwise plain stone wall. The door stood out due to the numerous designs tastefully etched across the surface. My Perception sphere had already picked up seven separate runes and three intertwined circles. At times like these, I dearly missed my phone. 'Could've just taken a photo now and studied them all in detail later. I hope I get a chance to go over them at some point.'

Francisa extended her hand and touched her palm on the Circle that was etched at the center of the door. It was one of the more distinguishable patterns, the other circles on either side barely visible in the waning light. I would've entirely missed the Runes if not for my ability. They were snugly hidden in the decorative but useless patterns scratched all over the door. I sneakily selected the constructs and ran identify on all three Circles, giving me respectively Circles of Authentication, Intimation, and Alarm from left to right.

I watched in fascination as she scrunched her eyebrows a bit in concentration. The middling Circle - which I assumed to be a form of a magical doorbell - glowed a slight blue spreading a bit across the other Circles, upon which she withdrew her hand. The glow faded after a few seconds as we waited. By the time the sun was halfway down the horizon, the door smoothly swung inside to reveal a dimly lit room and a man in dark robes standing at the threshold.

Squinting my eyes slightly, I noticed that the robes were not dissimilar to my own. Except the color was deep purple instead of bright crimson and more importantly, instead of magic Circles, it had what appeared to be absolute hogwash. Not a single Rune lit up in my perception, despite the nouveau riche appearance and close imitation of Runes.

"F-Fredrick!?!" Francisa almost squealed. "Why are you here?"

"Hello to you too, dear Francisa. As for why I am here - well, I am one of the _only_ two apprentices to His Eminence, The Royal Archmage. As such, I have leave to come and go from the tower as I deem necessary." He then turned to me, inspecting me over from head to toe, not once but twice. Our eyes met, and he puffed a small breath. 'What crawled up this NPC's ass today?'

Turning to Francisa again, he continued. "The hero's session is not till sundown. My master is not so idle as to accommodate those who have otiose time to spare."

"Fredri-"

"But," he cut her off, "since it is you asking, princess, I shall oblige." So saying, he turned his back with a flourish and headed inside. Sending an apologetic glance towards me, Francisa gestured for me to follow her as she walked inside. Her gait was not the princess-y strut she often employed but an unwieldy slog, as if carrying a mountain on her delicate shoulders.

I shrugged and followed. This should be one of the last cut-scenes, I presumed. Once I get a "training" schedule, I would be free to experiment again. And finally, start looking for a way out.

## Interlude - A Maid's Resolve

"Elise. Such a beautiful name!" My Ma used to tell me. "A beautiful name for a beautiful girl."

Hah. Fat lotta good it did me.

Beautiful girls with beautiful names don't last long in the slums. At least, they don't stay beautiful for long.

Yet, even horny fucks with grabby hands won't touch you if you're smeared in mud and shit, not when they have other options. I learned that quite early on. Had to, if I ever wanted to get outta there in one piece.

Surrounded by dirt and filth, my heart always sought better places. Safer places. Less smelly places. "Your prince will come, baby-girl." My Ma used to console little me with dreams of a man coming to pick me up from my misery one fine day. Worse, I believed her.

As I grew up, I wished for _anyone_ to come take me away. My ways of smearing myself to escape notice were not working anymore. I had taken after my Ma, turning shapely in the right ways.

One evening, when some drunk bastard decided he wanted the daughter along with the mother for company, _I_ decided I had enough. Fuck princes, if I waited any longer I'd end up like my Ma - stumbling from one drunk fool at day to another violent ass come night.

That very night, I packed my bags. I was gone by the time dawn broke. "One day Ma, I'll return," I swore, "and _I_ will come to pick you up from this shit-hole and take you to a better place."

I did not say goodbye. It would've broken her weak heart. Besides, I was planning to return someday. She would understand.

I never saw my Ma again, God bless her poor soul.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

I was blossoming into a beautiful young woman by the time I passed fifteen summers. And I used it fully to my advantage.

A proper noble boy he was. About a year younger than me.

Oh, the promises he made. Eternal Love. Heart, Mind, and Soul. Forever and Always!

Hah.

Still, I played the maiden in love perfectly. Blushed at his proclamations. Demurred at his gifts. I had him wrapped around my little finger.

And so we hatched a plan to stay together "forever."

I became a maid of his household and two days later, I lost my purity to him.

I was finally here. I had made it. Safe. Well-fed. Warm. Dare I say, happy? My Ma would've been overjoyed to see me here.

And then I caught his seed.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

Soon, I learned that some Nobles were no less cruel than the filthy slum dwellers I had escaped from. Just wrapped in fancy threads speaking fancy words.

They threw me out when I started to show. With rags on my back and a few coppers to my name.

The boy, bless his heart, still had lingering affection for me. So he set me up in a homely shack on the outskirts of a village inside their lands.

I carried through without too much difficulty, delivering a healthy babe. I named her Minerva, after my Ma. With Minerva's father's sneaky help, I had just enough to keep me and my girl warm and well-fed. The villagers were quite kind as well. I was content.

A few summers passed. The noble boy turned into a man, with a wife by his side. We spoke no more. It was fine though, I did odd jobs around the village, my skills as a noble's maid were quite handy often. I was not lacking for anything.

It was Minny's sixth summer when the signs started showing. A dizzy moment here, a stumbled foot there. I had hoped she would recover in time. The kindly neighbors provided some herbs and concoctions. Nothing helped. Once she passed out in the field playing with her mates not a month later, I decided to act.

I reached out to her father once again. Age may have turned the boy into a stoic young man, but his heart still thrummed with compassion. Against his dear wife's wishes, he arranged for a healer. Not the magical mender - they were too costly for a bastard daughter - but an Alchemist who dabbled in healing potions.

The Alchemist, in turn, contrived a potion that would delay her symptoms. "I've done what I can, but she needs a proper Healer," He warned. Where in the clear blue sky is a "proper Healer" gonna drop from in this backwater village? I was at my wit's end. Why does the world persist in fucking me around? Had I not suffered enough?

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

"Ma?" my sweet baby looked up with teary eyes.

"Hush babe. No crying. Mama's gotta get back to work." I held her steady in my arms.

"How long will you be gone this time?" She brushed off her tears with a dirty hand. For a moment, it reminded me of my own filthy hands smearing muck on my tattered tunic as a young girl. I chased the thought away.

"Not long Minny. Who knows, next time, I might just bring a Healer along and cure you in no time. You'll see. In the meantime, you gonna be a good girl, yes? Do not trouble old Martha too much."

"Yes, Mama." Ah, such a good little girl. I _knew_ she won't trouble anyone. Never had.

I kissed her forehead and left. Minny's father had been kind enough to open up doors for me into the Royal Palace. It had been a real struggle, but I had managed to secure a job in the end. If there was anywhere that I could find a Healer and earn enough coin to hire one, it was here. Minerva's final chance. I wasn't gonna let my baby girl down.

'Hey, need a hand?' The words still echoed around my mind.

Had the hero really offered to clean up plates? 'Nah. The fucker must've wanted a chance to grab my ass.' I still had a shapely ass. These high-born blokes won't touch a dirty plate even if their life depended on it.

But I knew the looks of men lusting after me. After all, I had gotten them all my life. _Avoided_ them all my life. The hero did not hanker after me like that. His eyes were kind, not unlike Minerva's father. Also, he had the princess waiting on him, did he not? No matter how beautiful I was in the slums, the nobles were on another level entirely - and the princess was the noblest among them. Even I got spent in her blue eyes sometimes when I dared to look into them.

'Bah. Thinking of it won't do me good. The sun was rolling down, and the fat bastard is waiting for me in his shitty tower.'

I made my way to the mage tower, carrying snacks as an excuse. The magic door was open and I headed straight up to the top. I sighted a few helpers running around. They glanced at me but no one stopped me.

"Ah, Elly. You're a sight for sore eyes." Lord fat ass was pacing around the lush carpet. 'I hope you get sore eyes for the rest of your life piggy.'

"Um, thank you, Sire. S-Should I...?" I acted a shy maiden. He preferred it so.

Then he loosed his trousers and sat on his bed with a loud thump. "Yes, and do get that plate of bhuna pumpkin while you're there."

I got his plate. He slurped on the sauce like a damn pig in heat. Minerva would have loved that sauce. One day...

I got down on my knees and got to work like a golem from the bard's story. Stone-faced soul-less automaton.

"He wants lessons! Can you believe it? I told him that there is no need to summon green-skinned outsiders - prophesy be damned, but Siegfried won't pay heed." He gushed as he licked the pumpkin sauce clean off the plate. Nobles got quite unnoble-like when they thought no one was looking. At least no one important.

"And then he asks me to tutor that pile of grime? _ME_? Archmage Arkanis? Even today, the beast-kin tremble upon hearing that name." 'Yes, yes. That would be the ninth time I hear of his glorious conquest this week. '

"Humph." His words came out quickly as his breathing hitched. "I'll show Siegfried. Even I- ah, that's good. Um..." He holds my skull in a vise-like grip. Gods, I always hated this part.

After a few moments of short grunts, I got off my sore knees. The blubber pulls his britches up and walked over to his shiny cupboard. A few fancy hand-wavy gestures and muttered words later, he procured a finger-long vial of clear liquid.

"Now, I spoke with a Healer friend of mine. And he is willing to cure your daughter. But-" He walked up to me, sickly sweet perfume wafting through my nostrils.

'Oh this fat lard, always with something clever. What more does he want? Take off his fancy clothes and sick perfume and he would fit right into the slum's gutter like a rat.'

"B-but? Sire?" I ask meekly.

"I have one more task for you." His sick smile sends a shiver up my spine. "I hear you serve the Mage hero. Take in his food, clean his room, draw his bath, so on." Darn, I see where this is going. "All you have to do is make sure the liquid in this vial comes into contact with his skin. A simple task really." So saying he placed the vial in my palm, not forgetting to feel my arms while at it.

"What is this... Liquid?" Of course, I knew what it was. But it was too sudden. I needed more time to think through this. So I extended the conversation.

"Oh, you need not worry yourself over it, Elly. Just a gift for our dear hero." He chuckled. How I hate when he says my name like that.

"B-but-" Warming the flab's bed is one thing. But cold-blooded murder?

"I must leave for now." He cut me off. "Have to confer with that blasted hero and the mewling princess, no less. I swear," 'My time is up.' "Do this task. One final task for me and your little daughter is as good as cured."

'My baby girl, or the kind hero?' A life for a life. 'Do I even have a choice?'

## Chapter 31 - Best of both worlds

I followed Francisa into a small room with a round stone table and a few wooden chairs around it.

Fredrick was waiting inside, holding a chair out with a slight smirk. Francisa went and sat down on it, a scowl persistent on her face. He then went on to sit right in front of her. I shrugged as I stepped in and sat in between them.

The silence was thick and tense. Fredrick still held a faint smirk as he gawked at Francisa. She, on the other hand, looked confused and angry in equal measure. Just as I was about to break the ice anyhow, the door opened again and another NPC walked in.

"Ah, greetings princess. You're here already?" A woman's voice echoed from behind me.

"Greetings Neysaa!" princess, losing her scowl, "Yes, the hero and I elected to get in a bit early."

The woman walked in from behind me towards the princess. As soon as she entered my sight, I noticed her tanned brown skin and the gait of those who kept themselves physically fit. She had a small light-blue crystal covered in Runes in her gloved hands, which she placed on the table.

"The hero?" She noticed me then. "Oh, Sir Pat. Greetings!" She greeted politely and curtsied. Her robe was similar to Fredrick's. All show and no function. At least she looked pretty in it. "I am Neysaa Ingrasia. Apprentice to the Royal Archmage."

"Greetings Neysaa." I decided to become formal henceforth with new NPCs. At least with _polite_ new NPCs. "I'm Pat, but you seem to have heard of me already. Nice to meet you."

"Of course. I was supposed to assist my master in setting up your tutelage here." She surmised. Turning to Fredrick with a small frown, she continued, "I did not expect Fredrick here, however."

"When I heard my old friend Francisa was coming, I begged His Eminence for his leave and he graciously allowed me to attend as well." He briefly glanced at Neysaa then went back to smirking at Francisa. "How goes it princess? Are you happy now that you got to fulfill your _duty_?"

"Fredric-" the princess started but was cut off again. Another person joined our little meet-up. And it was not little anymore.

An NPC who appeared on died of French Fries and Cheeseburgers sauntered into the room. Fredrick stood up and bowed so low I feared his hair might sweep the ground. "Master!" he spoke with a passion. Neysaa was not far behind. With a formal bow no different than what she gave me, she intoned respectfully - "Master Arkanis". Francisa got up and gave a short bow, one that could even pass as a nod. Going with the flow, I got up as well and nodded to the man. I even smiled, to be polite. He sniffed.

Then he ambled around the table and sat down in front of me. The rest took their seats as well. He held up his palm at the crystal and whispered something too low for me to hear, and the Runes on the crystal shined with a whitish-blue glow.

"Place your hand on the sphere." He spoke in a bored tone.

I looked at the glowing crystal. I sort of knew what it was, but couldn't help myself. "What is this crystal?"

It was Fredrick who answered. "It's a Status Sphere. It shows your Status Window. Every Noble worth their salt has access to one. Even commoners get to access it when they come of age. To think the hero has never even seen it -"

"Enough banter, Fredrick. Do not waste time." The Archmage admonished Fredrick. Perhaps it was angled at me as well?

'But why do they need an artifact to check their Status Windows. Do they not have Spells for it?' I stashed the mystery for another time. Apparently, the guy had a tight schedule. Without hesitation, I placed my hand on the crystal and a small window became visible above just my hand after a second.

'Wait, this is incomplete - I have a couple more special effects!'

"Pff" Fredrick snickered. Neysaa and Francisa were staring at the screen with wide eyes.

"Do you have no Skills, hero?" Arkanis questioned. This was the first time since he entered that I saw him without his blasé attitude. He seemed curious, amused even.

"No, I don't." 'The Mages here get Skills? Betty mentioned something like that.'

Fredrick chimed in. "A hero with no Skills. Barely at level 20. Deliver us from calamity? Even my younger brother could do better, and he is not thirteen summers yet!" There was still a faint echo of hilarity in his expression.

Francisa soon came out of her daze. "It matters not. He may still use Runes as he sees fit." She gave me a small smile.

"Humph. Not even worth all the trouble..." Arkanis was muttering something to himself. Eventually, he got up with a flourish, picked up the crystal, and left the room; dictating an "I leave this to you" to Neysaa, who was still lost in her own world.

Fredrick leered at Francisa. "See you around, Francisa!" He followed his master out.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

"So..." I glanced at Francisa, then at Neysaa, "What's next?"

"Ahem," Neysaa was apparently done with her ruminations, "The lack of Skills matters not, for the duration of training at the very least."

"Those two were making quite a deal about it though?" I countered.

"Well, Mages can sustain themselves on just Runes, but Rune Scrolls are usually one-time use only while being less effective as similar Skills; and the mana cost is quite significant. Etching a Rune Circle takes too much time and effort to be useful in traditional combat, not to mention they are notoriously difficult to get right. Innate Skills, however, are quite easy on the mana and can be cast in a blink. Not to mention infinitely reusable with a steady supply of mana potions. It may not matter much when working in a large party, the army, or even in a group of Mages. But as a hero -"

"I'll be venturing out in small party where without Skills, I can only depend on a small supply of expensive and ineffective Rune Scrolls. Basically, making me useless. But what about Spells?" I wondered. 'I did pull my weight in the Tutorial, didn't I?'

"Pah. Surely you jest, Sir Pat." Neysaa giggled as she stood from the chair. Francisa answered my query instead.

"The Spells are only visible with the Status Spheres, which are rare enough as is. And no new Spells have been created in the last three hundred years. Each Clan guards their Spell books zealously. The Runes are created from those Spells. The Runes, and as an extension the Scrolls and Circles, are thus more or less set in stone. No one uses Spells anymore beyond that. They are more blueprints than tools of war."

"Aptly put, princess." Neysaa walked to the door, holding it open. "I'm aware you seek many answers Sir Pat, but it is time for us to retire today. We shall sit here again on the morrow after breaking fast. I shall be more than happy to supply any answers that I can. I am to be your tutor, after all!"

We said our farewells and I started my stroll back to the palace. Francisa drifted beside me, glancing at me now and then with furrowed brows.

"Something on my face?" I asked lightly.

"Uh, n-no Pat." She hesitated. "It's, uh, about Fredrick..."

'Hmm, not that I care but she looks eager to vent. Guess I should hear her out?'

"Fredrick?" I nudged her on.

"Yes." She held her hands tightly together. "He, uh, may have had feelings for me for a time. For the way he acted today, I beg your forgiveness on his behalf."

Honestly, I was more curious about the Archmage. His dark purple robe had several intermingling Runes. But he acted aloof and ran off before I even had an opportunity to talk properly. I assumed Fredrick was just coded as an asshole NPC and did not give him another thought.

"Um, sure. I don't really mind. What about you? Have you _had_ feelings for him too?" I teased her. Ostensibly, I touched a sore spot.

"N-no. I never... I belong to Sir Pat now. Please, believe me." I noticed moisture forming on the corner of her eyes. Her hands were clamped together so hard that they turned white. She stopped walking and bowed her head. "I swear on my name as the Royal Princess of Clan Lohengramm."

'Wha-?' I stood still, gawking at her sudden change in demeanor. She let out a soft and mightily suppressed sob. Before it could turn into a full-fledged river of tears, however, I hastily consoled her.

"Hey, hey! Francisa. Look at me." I held her shoulders. "Come now, raise your head. I was just joking, okay? It is not your fault but mine. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?"

It took the rest of our march back to the palace to calm her down. 'Hold on, did she say she belonged to me now?'

I decided against broaching the subject again. We had a full dinner again, with me digging into interconnections of Spells, Runes, Scrolls, and Circles. My gap of general knowledge regarding magic usage in the Simulation was slowly filling up.

<br />
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>¤ ¤ ¤</strong></p>
<br />

"Aye, and he just disappears right in front of my eyes; like poof!"

We were in my room. Carol, Arya, and I were sitting at the table laden with bread and some hot green liquid. It was not tea. Carol was currently engaged in recalling her introduction with her mentor. My usual maid was frolicking in the corner. 'What was her name again? Elaine? Damn it, I forgot.'

"Looks like you both got along well with your tutors. And _I_ have to read the daily journal, or I should say fanatic mutterings, of some dead old woman." Arya complained as she tore her bread with a vengeance. Her tutor had still not been decided. In the meantime, she was provided with Francisa's great-grandmother's effects to study. Effects as in, a few ancient books and a broken staff to be precise. Somehow related to a Church of Healers.

I had already regaled them with the description of the new NPCs and my interactions with them from last night. "Heh, don't worry Arya, you'll get yours soon enough. And did your mentor get your Status checked as well Carol?"

"Oh, yea. He did place a wee shiny bauble in my hands. It was missing some effects though." Carol mused. "He said I was very lucky with my Skills. They are quite rare, he says."

"And I was almost laughed out the room for having no Skills." I sniffed.

"But it doesn't matter for you, right? What with your magic spells and stuff." Arya queried while taking a sip of the bitter not-tea.

"Well, yes. I can simply flick my finger up and check the Spells. But these NPCs cannot even see their Status Windows without that crystal." I supplied. 'Dare I risk another sip myself?' "I haven't told them that yet. Been wondering if I should at all. It would turn their world upside down, at least for the Mage Class."

"uoah thinfin toh muh." Carol must've come across a particularly stubborn piece of bread.

'Was I?' The crystals were somewhat of a status symbol in this world. Holding one not only signified their high position in the hierarchy, but also gave them the power to create Runes. If they came across someone who could "Identify" without the crystal? Cast Spells bypassing the Runes like their Skills but not restricted to them? Create new Spells from scratch? 'Imagine the chaos!' Even the system itself was hiding information from the NPCs. Perhaps caution was the best approach.

"I'm gonna learn how to turn Spells into Runes today." I continued the conversation. "Runes are supposedly the building blocks of this world's entire magical system. They draw them into Circles to do magic. Some Circles are etched on surfaces to make them permanent. Like my hood on the robe there. They also ink Runes on a piece of paper for a one-time effect. Scrolls, they call them."

"Interesting. How are Scrolls different from Circles?" Arya, very much into the explanation.

"Circles are intricate connections of a large number of Runes, designed for extreme efficiency. Least mana for most effect. They all are also, well, circular for some reason. Some high-level Circles are made up of many low-level Circles. And most Circles require multiple Mages and sustained supply of mana to react." I took the leap, finally sipping on the bitter liquid to hydrate my parched throat. Scrolls, on the other hand, are not restricted to a circular shape, for one. Also, they take up too much mana and have less of a response. A Scroll of lightning, for example, will either throw less lightning, or work for a shorter time, or both; as compared to a Circle. It does use a lot less time, effort, and resources to make that Scroll of lightning, however, as compared to etching a Circle of lightning on a staff. And the Scroll can be used by a single Mage in a pinch, with no issues. Also, a minute mistake while engraving the Circle and the staff is useless." I concluded my explanation.

"And then _you_ have your Spells," Carol smirked.

"And then I have my Spells." I smiled. "Best of both worlds. And then some."
