## Chapter 37 - Work in Progress

"Indeed it is so." Kai let out a sigh, "It concerns the Calamity."

"I see..." I nodded. I figured the main campain would come bite me in the ass _some_ day, but this was too soon. "What exactly is this calamity?" I asked, hoping I'd get a straight answer for once. "And people around here seem quite chilled out considering their world is about to end."

"The Calamity is... depravation manifest. It hungers for life itself, seeking to twist it towards a vile purpose. It consumes all it comes across from the smallest insect to the eldest tree. I have no knowledge of how or why it was unleashed, the spirits of ancestors answer those questions with silence. But they do say that it cannot be fought by mortal means. And that soon it shall cover the entire the whole world." Kai spoke with a heavy voice. "The people here, they are born distant from the horrors of the Calamity. They _know_ what they face, for their ancestor pass the stories onwards, but they do not _understand_ the terrible devastation of it. For them, it is still a danger far into the future, and now that the heros have arrivied, they have discarded their responsibility towards it."

'Alright, alright. Forget about the NPC attitudes for now, focus on the main villian. So the Calamity is like a... Plague? Yeah, that's a good mental model. How is it spreading across oceans though?' I stared at Kai cradling what looked to be a ceremonial drum, giving me time to parse her words. 'Assuming it is a plague, it must be incurable even by healing magic for it to have affected so much. Must be magical in nature. And according to Francisa, the onset of this Calamity is marked by crazed beasts. So the plague turns everyone into monsters. If this hypothesis is correct, then it means the cure would be some magical anti-viral spell. How does a dungeon factor into this then? Is the spell locked up in there?'

I looked up, Kai's face still graced by a patient smile. Guess I should enquire more about it now that I have a willing NPC spouting exposision. "How did the ancestors fight against it?"

"Oh," the smile dimmed on Kai's face. "They didn't."

"What do you mean?" Fracisa couldn't be lying about her great-grandfather.

"Can a deer fight a cyclone?" Kai questioned me in turn. "Can a weasal stand against bushfire? No, Hero. They did not fight. They were simple fodder for the unending hunger."

'Weird analogies, but okay. This sounds less like a final boss and more like an apocalypse.' I gulped.

"So... How do _we_ fight it?" I asked.

Kai smiled, more fully than she had before. Then showed me her colorful drum, like a child showing off their first sketch. "This artifact has been handed down through the shamans Dakota tribe since times immemorial." She caressed the vibrant red and brown covering, interpersed with thick black and yellow stitches - all faded with time. "The moment I held it in my hands, I realised I would be the last one of our tribe to carry it."

She set it down on the ground between us, and leaned back the rummaged through her back coverings. "Ah, there it is." She withdrew a small black knife with bone handle from the impressive layers. "The realization came with little sorrow, for I knew that this was never meant to be ours. Rather, I felt pride that I would finally fulfill the purpose that has been carried out by my betters for ages uncounted." She clutched the drum again, gazing fondly at the instrument. "The spirites whispered of this moment, of when I would hand over the key to a Hero. I always feared, however, if it would ever come to pass, especially as the blood cooled in my veins with age. For all their knowledge, they are not all-knowing."

"Wha-" Before I could finish speaking up, she plunged her knife into the drum, tearing out a segment across the diameter of the head. Then she placed the knife aside and plunged her hand in, apparently diging for something. Before long, she pull our a bright white round object with golden filigree. Insane number of runes immediatly lightup in my perception. I quickly threw an Identify at it.

'Just great. Thanks for nothing System!'

Kai handed the thingy to me. It felt like polished marble. Cold and hard to touch. The golden circles were etched such that they didn't make any groves on the white surface, making the entire thing incredibly smooth. The design was so advanced that I couldn't even make out individual circles, let alone the minute runes. After examining the supposed key for a while, I looked up at Kai. She noticed my attention and immedialy wiped a morose expression that had crept on her face, putting the drum behind and pointedly ignoring it. I decided not to comment on that, instead focusing on the reason I had been kidnapped.

"It's a key eh? What door does it open?" I asked, rolling the sleek stone in my hand.

Kai make a noise halfway between a snort and a laugh.
