# Volume 1 - Tutorial

## Prologue

I opened my eyes to a dark sky. 'Not a cloud in sight, must be late at night. Oh, no stars even in this dark, interesting...' I thought; 'Wait... Why am I looking for stars? Where the hell am I?'. There was diffused lighting about, the kind you would get on a late sunny evening, but I couldn't pinpoint a source. My wandering hands found hold of dry grass beside my prone body. Now I was worried. I quickly got up and looked around. Some sort of plain landscape surrounded by what looked to be high cliffs on all sides but one. There were some people gathered there, so that was where I made my way.

As I sauntered over to the group, I saw a figure floating in the air. I did a quick double-take. 'What the hell!?!' There was a woman in Egyptian-esque costume floating off the ground, her eyes closed. Surrounded by 5 more people. Thankfully, the people were quite grounded - and looked as confusing as I felt. From the looks of it, they had gathered quite recently as well. Just as I was about to ask what the f+ck was going on, the floating woman opened her eyes, looked over us all as if making sure we were paying attention, then exclaimed -

"Welcome, to the Grand Simulation!"

The Cleopatra look-alike continued after a slight pause, "Congratulations! You all have been chosen as test subjects for acceptance testing of Grand Simulation v389.12.425. My name is Betty, and I am here to answer any and all the questions you have. Please ask away!"

One of the people standing about, a tall wiry-thin blonde woman, quickly asked: "Where the f+ck am I?" - well, you took the words right out of my mouth there sister. Betty looked at the woman and answered without missing a beat, "You are currently in the Spawn Point for test subjects. The Spawn Point is located inside the Tutorial Dungeon. The Tutorial Dungeon is located in the memory region of the Simulation itself; it is, however, removed from the space and time constraints of the main program!"

The blonde had her mouth hanging open. I noticed that after I managed to gather my own slack jaws. Before anyone else could ask anything else, I spoke up - "How do we get back home?". Betty's eyes, which were trained on the blonde so far, now bore into me. They seemed devoid of life for some reason. She spoke in her eerie voice again "To get out of the Tutorial, and the Simulation as a whole, you must be deleted; in other words, you must die." Not only did our mouths hang open again like a sinkhole, I felt several hearts skip a beat, or perhaps just mine skipping more than once. We all looked at each other, but no one spoke for a while.

"Anoo... How are you flying?" a black-haired youth on my left asked. He had been gawking at Betty for a while. 'Quite the silver-lining kind of guy we have here; also she is not flying, just floating' I argued uselessly in my mind. Betty turned to him in her mechanical manner - I was glad she wasn't staring at me anymore and answered: "It is a spell that inverses gravity until the mass of my body is balanced off by the pull in either direction at an elevation of 2.73 meters off the ground". While that was a lot to chew on, I immediately caught on something - 'float SPELL?'. Apparently, the silver-lining kid did as well - he was practically shaking with excitement. "*You can do magic?*", he asked her. She replied again - perhaps it was only me, but it looked like she was expecting this question, "Why yes! Everyone in the Simulation can cast spells and do magic. Even you! Some classes are restricted to only using said spells while other classes can actively tweak other spells or create new ones entirely!". 'Classes? Magic? What...?'

"Ummm... Is there any other way of getting out of this... Simulation. Besides, you know, dying?" a fair doe-eyed girl asked from beside the blonde. "I'm afraid there isn't", Betty replied and continued eyeing the poor girl as if mocking her. While everyone digested that, I put in another question, "What are we supposed to do here?". To which Betty replied after setting her glare on me, "First, you must complete the Tutorial to get to the base level of human adults in the Simulation; once you finish the Tutorial and enter the Simulation, you are free to do as you wish".

···

Betty wasn't going anywhere soon; the blonde had confirmed that with her. So here we were, introducing ourselves at blondie's insistence; she went first -

"You all can call me Julie. I'm a lawyer, and I live in Berlin" she said and looking around for whoever was going next. Another plump looking girl with a reddish hair-do by her side coughed slightly to get everyone's attention.

I suddenly noticed that there were three women, all on my right, grouped up. And two guys standing some distance apart to my left. The Japanese kid and another slightly overweight guy. Everyone was either around my age of mid-20s or younger than me. The girl continued her introduction since no one interrupted -

"I'm Carol, Irish. I am studying Uni". With that, she did a slight nod of her head and stepped back. If not for the current situations, I could see her being the life of a party, or being mischievous in general. No one spoke up next, so I did.

"Name's Pat, I'm a Programmer". I said my piece and stayed silent. No point in wasting too many words. The Japanese guy went next.

"Hajimemashta, my name is Taro. I am 17 years old, a high school student from Japan" he said and looked around with a carefree smile as if he knew some secret no one else did. What I'd give to know where his cheery attitude came from!

"Divin's the name, I am from Congo. I own a small business" said the guy in a deep voice. The only remaining girl had the attention of us all; she didn't seem too keen on talking but spoke nonetheless -

"I am Arya", she said simply. 'To the point, are we?'

'Good, now that's done, back to getting the hell out of doge' I thought. Apparently, so did everyone else, as we all turned back to Betty for an in-depth interrogation session. 'Please let this just be some weird dream' I prayed. If only I knew the kind of sh+t I was going to end up in, I might have prayed harder, a lot harder...

## Chapter 1 - Chat Bot

"Why are we here?" (Julie)

"You all are test subjects for -" (Betty)

"No, I mean, why are *WE* here? Why us?" (Julie)

"Oh, you were randomly sampled from your planet with uniform distribution of gender and location. Also, your ability to speak, read and write the common language with certain fluency favored your selection to a degree" (Betty)

"..."

"Can't you just send us back?" (Carol, looking a bit hopeful)

"I'm afraid I cannot send you back" (Betty)

"How do I do magic?" (Taro, still excited)

"First, you must select a Class. There are 6 base Classes that anyone can choose from, although you may choose only one; all Classes have the ability to cast magic. However, only Healer and Mage Classes can create spells on their own. Other Classes rely on their Skills to intuitively cast magic." (Betty)

"Sweet, how do I get a Class?"  (Taro)

"To get a - " (Betty)

"Wait, hold on. What the hell is this? Just how are we here? Am I dreaming or something? Why can't you send us back home? You basically kidnapped us and are now forcing us to do whatever. I want to go home!" (Me, slightly losing it)

"This is the Tutorial Dungeon. You are not dreaming. You can leave the Simulation by deleting yourself" (Betty)

"OK, so how did you bring us here? I don't remember being nabbed or anything" (Me)

"I did not bring you here, I am here just to answer your questions" (Betty)

"So... *How* exactly did we end up here?" (Arya, backing me up)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Why not?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Yeah I know, you just said that. I'm asking why not?" (Me, exasperated)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"..."

"She's a dammed chatbot! Just great! Stuck inside a simulation with a bunch of strangers and a smart-ass bot." (Me, mostly to myself but came out loud)

"You're a chatbot, aren't you?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot - " (Betty)

"Of course you cannot..." (Me, grumbling to myself again)

"Ano... How do I get a Class again?" (Taro, looking at me as if asking me to shut up)

"To get a Class, you must open up your Status Window. You can open your Status Window by swiping up with a finger. Before you select a Class, I recommend going through the descriptions to get one most suited to yourself, as you will be stuck with that Class and its evolution tree for the rest of Simulation" (Betty)

Everyone swiped their finger in the air and got a glazed look in their eyes. I did as well, and a virtual reality type window opened up. It was empty save for two things - a "Select Class" red glowing text and a tiny tilde ~ symbol at the bottom right. I was about to click on "Select Class" when I heard Divin, who had been silent so far, speak up.

"Why are you dressed like that?" (Divin, deadpanned)

"This Simulation and everything in it has been constructed with inspiration taken from your planet's stories from the ages, be they history or fantasy. As for this particular attire, it was meant to stand out so I could attract your attention when you spawn here" (Betty)

"Is that so..." (Divin, quieting down)

Now dragged out of our concentration from admiring the Status Windows, another barrage of questions was fired at Betty.

"What about our necessities? Like food, water, etc?" (Julie)

"You do not need sustenance in the Tutorial Dungeon. This place is outside of the main program and not subject to the same space and time constraints; as such you are exempt from hunger, thirst, and sleep for the duration of your stay. You will, however, get injured or fatigued as you expend health or stamina points, and will require treatment or rest to reclaim it" (Betty)

"So we just... Finish this tutorial and get out of here? All on our own?" (Arya)

"This Tutorial aims to bring you to the baseline of an adult human in the Simulation. You may act alone, or in groups. I will, however, follow along until you have completed the Tutorial Dungeon to answer any and all questions you have. Please ask away!" (Betty)

No one asked anything. Apparently, Betty was going to stick around, or rather float around, for quite a while. We all went back to our Status Windows to read the Class Descriptions.

## Chapter 2 - Class Selection

I clicked on Select Class text. Nothing happened. My hand went through the window. I looked at the interface for a while. I tried clicking the tilde symbol. Same nothing. I looked about and saw others going through similar ordeals. Eventually, Taro whined impatiently at Betty "Nothing is happening, my finger goes through it! How do I click on this?" Betty immediately answered, "Physical interaction with the Status Window was phased out 254 major versions ago, to 'click' on an item, simply focus on the same. While a bit unwieldy at first, stats show that such interaction is 28 times more efficient than the previous medium."

I focused on the text, and immediately the screen was replaced by a bunch of sections - six, to be precise. I slowly scrolled through each section, reading the brief description of each.

---

KNIGHT - Base Class

Sword-wielding swashbuckler, adept at mêlée combat; very high strength attribute with the ability to use quick skills in addition to the sword and keep up a good defense at the same time.

SCOUT - Base Class

With high agility and stealth attributes, scouts generally prepare for the arrival of the main party - be it by securing the route ahead or scoping out the enemy camp for potential incursion points.

HEALER - Base Class

With a good leg up on intelligence and endurance attributes, healers take care of their health, and that of others, by topping it off with pre-defined skills or customized spells.

CRAFTSMAN - Base Class

Low but well-rounded attributes, get an extra utility skill on each Class upgrade. Create or modify items, enchantments, and structures from scratch with the right materials and skills.

ARCHER - Base Class

Focusing on dexterity and agility, this long ranger either distracts an opponent so the party can get close or goes in for the killer shot on a distracted one, adapting to the situation as required.

MAGE - Base Class

Very high intelligence at the cost of other attributes. Instead of getting a pre-defined skill when leveling up, craft highly specialized and equally deadly personal spells.

---

Ha... My Class was set a while ago when Betty mentioned them for the first time. I focused on selecting that class and the window went back to the main screen describing my Class and current Status

I was feeling quite good about myself. I looked around to see that others were still absorbed in their screens. I waited a minute, then another. After 5 min, I was quite sure something was amiss. I asked Betty about the tutorial to while away time. According to her, there were 20 levels going down until the 'Exit Portal' at the bottom. We were currently on level 0. You couldn't enter a higher level unless you were at that level or higher. She mentioned that the tutorial was tailored to get us to level 20, which was the baseline of adult humans in this (well, the outer simulated) world. She wouldn't go in-depth about the environment of each level and other details, so I figured it was more 'explore-and-see' kind of thing the creators were going for. She wouldn't answer who the creators were, what or who the test was by, and for, or absolutely anything that had nothing to do with the Simulation itself. I tried several different variations but her lips were sealed tight.

This back and forth went on for another 15 minutes I reckon, when people started coming to. I looked around to hear what each had chosen. Hopefully, not everyone had chosen the Mage class.

···

"Man, the Mage class is so nerfed! And here I was, foolishly looking forward to it." Taro exclaimed. 'Wait... What?'

"Yeah", Carol agreed, "When I looked at the detailed description and attribute distribution, it was even below the Craftsman class. Anyway, I chose the Scout. What about you two?" 'Heh?'

"I chose Knight", he said - as if it should have been obvious, and looked at me expectantly.

"Ummm, what do you mean when you say the Mage class is nerfed? And what's this about attribute distribution?" I asked them instead. To which Taro replied, "Well if you focused on getting detailed info about a certain Class, you could see in-depth information about their capabilities, roles, and growth potentials. I say Mage is nerfed because that class does not get any skills as other classes do. They have to create spells on their own to use magic. Why would anyone want to do research here?", with a pause, he continued, "Also, all the attributes were lowest I could see compared to others - even craftsmen had a good 3 on most, except for intelligence. What's the point of starting with lots of mana when you can't even use it, right? And I don't even know how one would go about building customized spells - sounds like a lot of work to me." Taro concluded. All I could think of was - 'Well... sh+t'

Carol chimed in, "Yeah, I even got 3 special effects for my class. I believe Mage had only one. What skills did you get for the Knight, Taro...". The conversation continued; eventually, the rest of the girls joined in. Arya took the Healer class, Julie the Archer. Finally, Divin joined in too. Apparently, he had taken the Knight class as well. There was a bit of hubbub over there not being any Craftsman, but I was too engaged in cursing my own stupidity and impatience to notice much of what was being said at the moment.

···

After a while, I told them that I had taken the Mage class. Thankfully, all I got were a few confused looks. It seems that the attributes were also dependent on the class. As such, the Knight class had a 'Vigor' attribute that resulted in extra HP regeneration, while the Scout had 'Stealth' attribute - I had neither. Arya had an 'Attunement' that affected the rate of healing applied to others. I realized I had no clue what effects attributes had, so I excused myself and took another look at the Status Window, this time willing it to show me attribute description.

---

| Attribute    | Affects                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physical attack damage dealt and received |
| Vitality     | Health Points                             |
| Agility      | Movement Speed                            |
| Dexterity    | Movement Range                            |
| Intelligence | Mana Points                               |
| Perception   | Magical attack range                      |
| Wisdom       | Magical attack defense |

---

I see. I have no special health regeneration; and every monster and their mother would notice me without the stealth attribute. Others also had a 'skills' section below special effects with one skill each already. While I was reading the attribute description, Carol was trying out a skill to silent her footsteps. With magic. And here I was - a Mage, twiddling my thumbs. Yeah, I was pretty pissed off at myself.

## Chapter 3 - Level 0

A dream is only a dream after you wake up. While you are dreaming, it becomes your reality. I believe all of us here had taken being kidnapped quite well, considering everything. At least no one broke down. I could tell Carol was putting up a brave front. Taro was actively enjoying it. Julie was still on the fence about whether to laugh or cry, but she was distracting herself by taking charge. Arya was silently sulking. I couldn't get a read on Divin though. As for me? I was wondering what my folks at home would be up to, they must've lost it by now. I decided to ask the Betty about it, not expecting an answer, "Hey, what about the people back on our planet, surely they would've noticed us missing?" Surprisingly, I got a response. "The Simulation is not subject to the space-time constraints of your world; just like the Tutorial is separate from the Simulation, the Simulation is separate from your reality." 'Ah, makes sense. It is like time has stopped there, eh?'

We gathered around Betty, ready to go where fate would lead us. Julie was just about to say something when Betty spoke up again - "So, you have all got your Classes, allow me to lend your starting equipment!" So saying, she raised her hand and down came a stream of light in front of each of us. Two swords in front of Taro and Divin, a bow and quiver full of arrows in front of Julie, a dagger for Carol and staff for Arya. I got nothing. "Ummm, my equipment seems to be missing?" I queried. "Mages don't need a physical weapon to attack", she said. 'What, are you kidding me?'. "At least, give me a dagger or something, just in case!" I begged. "I'm afraid I cannot". I looked around and got only sympathetic looks. I didn't give up though, "But I do not know any magic spells. How am I supposed to defend myself?". "I'd recommend creating a spell", she said. "I didn't really go to Hogwarts, you know. I have absolutely no clue how to go about making or using a spell!" I bit back. "While I do not have the data of how you should create your spell, I am certain you must use your Status Window to create one. For reference, allow me to upload my floating spell into your repository..."

I opened up my Status Window again and immediately noticed that the tilde (~) symbol at the bottom was bold. I focused on it and a terminal-like screen opened up. It was blank save for one line:

`float o = (while (o.elevation < 2.73) _____.gravity--)`

I was dumbstruck. 'Sh+t...It's a god damned program. True, it looks like an unholy union of Haskell and Javascript, with bits of Lisp and redacted code in between; but I recognize it nonetheless. And I actually have a shell to work on? F+cking A!' I almost did a small victory dance but contained myself hastily. My smile must have betrayed me, however, as Arya had a weird look in her eyes.

"Perhaps we should get going now?" Julie broke the awkward silence and looked at Betty. Betty didn't move a muscle. Seems like she meant it literally when she said she will be *following* us. Another moment later, Julie huffed a bit, shouldered her bow and arrows, and lead the way out of the Spawn Point clearing. Just as we stepped out of the choke point leading out onto a wide road, Betty turned from Cleopatra to Will-'O-the-Wisp. It was Carol who spoke up, "Why'd ya turn into a ball of light?" to which Betty replied, "It is easier to split into multiple entities in this form, and it is also lighter on resource consumption" 'Ah, she did say she would follow us all even after we went individually. So this is how. Weird, but logical.' Apparently, Carol thought so too, because she didn't have any follow-up questions.

···

The unremarkable road eventually lead us to an unremarkable field. It was big enough to fit a couple of football stadiums. Albeit barren of any fauna, it was sprouting something oozy in large quantities. Wait, are these slimes? "What is this?" Julie enquired, motioning in the general direction of the slimes. Betty-the-wisp spoke up, "This is Level 0 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Slime Field" 'Clever naming sense there' "The entrance to Level 1 is on the opposite side of our current position; you must cross this field and reach level 1 before you can proceed further"

I looked around the field. If was filled with slimes of all sizes and colors. The one thing they all had in common was how lazily they were ambling towards nowhere in particular. I was quite absorbed in taking in the view, so I missed the moment when Taro and Julie made their move. Taro moved ahead, sword held up in both hands in front of him, while Julie took out her bow and notched an arrow. This was when I noticed their actions and thought to myself 'We should have made a plan first. Even a signal would've been appreciated'.

Julie let loose the arrow, which zoomed in quite rapidly towards a particularly large green slime ball. I was impressed - until it harmlessly hit the ground. Taro wasn't faring any better. He tried slashing his sword into a smaller blue slime, but the creature brushed it off and bounced back. The attack had caused a commotion and three more slimes were headed to Taro's location. Another arrow, another slash - no effect. The slimes were gathering. Carol had joined in at some point, covering Taro's flank. Divin, Arya and I were standing a distance away, behind Julie.

The other slimes were now closer and surrounding Taro and Carol. Some others were headed in our direction, probably due to Julie digging up dirt near them with her arrows. Suddenly, a blue slime jumped out of the crowd and slammed into Taro's chest. He fell flat on his butt. Carol came to him and gave her his hand when another yellow slime smashed into her back. Thankfully, she braced herself somehow. Both of them ran back to where we were standing. Julie also stopped shooting. The crowd of slimes was now considerable and headed in our direction like an avalanche. We hightailed it out of there and almost came back to the Spawn Point itself.

···

"Well, that sucked!" Julie started, "I am down to half my arrows" she moaned.

"I tried hitting their core, but they kept slipping in and out of the crowd" Taro continued.

"Perhaps we need a plan?" Carol chimed in.

"Yes. They are attracted to arrows, which we can use to draw one in; isolate it from others and destroy its core." Divin suggested. 'So, you noticed as well, eh? Nice plan though'

This back and forth continued while I realized there wasn't anything I could contribute. 'No, can't keep things like this. Need to create a spell somehow.' I again excused myself, letting them know of my intentions and headed further back to the center of the Spawn Point.

While I hyped myself up, I couldn't change the fact that I had no clue what to do. A splinter of Betty followed me, the original staying with the rest. I opened up my Status Window and focused on the tilde symbol. The terminal opened up and I gave it a closer look.

Focus with an intent - this was how I concluded the interaction worked. So I focused on the window, willing it to write down the words in my head. Wait, what spell do I want? Let's go with the most generic one.

`fireball =`

Holy Sh+t! Is this awesome or what? Editing with literal thoughts. These guys have achieved *perfection* itself!

It took me a minute to wrap my head around this, but eventually, I calmed down. I looked at the float spell again. It took an argument of 'o'. 'Perhaps I could give a target to the fireball with an argument? How do I actually throw a ball of fire anyway? Wish there was a manual page I could refer to - man, do I miss the internet! Oh wait, I have a literal AI chatbot by my side. Let's see if I can scrape something out of her. It is only a matter of asking the right questions!'

"Hey Betty, do you know how I can create a fireball spell?" I asked a straight question, not expecting an answer. I wasn't disappointed. "I'm afraid I do not", she said. "So, how do I interact with the environment?" I continued. "You must use the environment variables", she replied. For a moment I thought she was having a laugh. She wasn't. 'OK good, got something' "How do I list the environment variables?" I asked. "I'm afraid I cannot answer that". 'Hmm... Would've been nice if you could' I decided to change the phrasing slightly, "How do I *use* the environment variables?". "You can modify the environment variables in your spell by focusing your intent inside the Status Window". 'Damn, no luck. Wait, how did she pass an argument to her float spell?' like a light bulb went off in my head, I was almost giddy when I asked her "Can you show me how you cast the float spell?" In retrospect, this should have been my first question, but I wasn't going to demean myself. While I was wondering about my shortcomings, she changed from her wisp form back to Cleopatra. I leveled a hard stare, not willing to miss a single twitch or whisper out of her. And then, she cast the float spell.

## Chapter 4 - Gesture Input

Betty took a few steps away from me. Raised her hands with palms towards her torso, then spoke in a clear voice - 'float'. As she rose from the ground, it seemed as if cobwebs were clearing in my mind. I gaped at her as she stabilized herself, but my thoughts were far away.

'Is this how a spell is cast then? You choose your target with your hands as an argument, then call the function - err spell, by name... She passed her own body as the argument, and now she is floating!'

I quickly opened my Status Window and got into the terminal. I erased the float spell with a thought. With another, I modified my fireball spell.

`fireball x = x.`

Well, I still didn't know how to call fire. I could choose any target into x and ignite it. 'Hmm... Environment variables she says? How about I just raise the temperature of the target to make it seem like it is on fire? Yeah, that could work' After another quick edit,

`fireball x = (x.temperature++)`

'Wait, increasing temperature by a degree would barely make the thing feverish. I need it to BURNNN. How about I double it?'

`fireball x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)`

I was itching to test it on something; so I closed my Status Window. Betty was back in her wisp form already. I looked at the ball of light - what if... No. It would be a tragically funny joke if a powerful Chat Bot went Rambo on me right now. I instead chose a patch of grass about 10 meters away. While the grass was dry, it was thankfully sparse overall. I could fireball it without needing a fire extinguisher. Taking a deep breath, I raised my hand. My palm was pointing towards a clump of a particularly dense patch. I spoke out as serenely as I could - 'fireball'. Nothing happened.

While the test was technically a failure, I did notice one important thing. When I raised my hand to "select" the clump of grass, I could somehow tell that it was too far away. Perhaps my perception was too low? I lowered my hand, now pointing to a blade of grass a couple of meters away. No sooner had I spoken the magic word that the blade seemed to swoon. Its color had also gotten a bit darker. Test Successful! I cast fireball again on the same blade and its color went pitch black. Even in the dark evening-like ambiance, it stood out from its peers. A slight breeze disintegrated it before my eyes.

As I noticed that, another crazy idea popped into my nugget. Why stop at double? Why not square it? Heck, I could call it recursively until my target is vaporized! Man, I don't care what others say, but the Mage class is not nerfed AT ALL. In fact, it is way too overpowered! Who cares about some attributes or special effects when you can simply smite stuff into oblivion? I immediately added a multiplier in my spell and cast it on another unfortunate blade of grass nearby. My expectations of utter destruction were betrayed however, as this time, nothing happened at all. Not even a small change in color. I reopened my Status Window and checked to see if I hadn't made any typos with my mind, but the code looked good. 'Oh wait, what is this?'

I had failed to notice it in my excitement earlier, but my Mana Point was down to 240 from the original 800. Did I just use up 560 points of mana to burn a blade of grass? As for why the last spell didn't work, I simply didn't have enough mana left. Guess Mages ain't so OP after all.

As I was resting to recover my mana - which according to Betty was quicker for Mages, I thought about the spell I just cast. Impressive as it was, it certainly wasn't what I expected. No literal fiery balls were shot around. How would one go about that, I wondered? Not that it mattered much, I now had an actual attack. Misnomer though it was. Hell, why not change it? It didn't take me long to come up with a pretty original and totally not stolen name -

`incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * x.temperature)`

I was quite proud of myself, as I decided to write another function that went the other way, with a similar naming scheme.

`petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = ((x.temperature / x.temperature) - 1))`

'Boom! Freeze mofo, all the way down to zero!!!'

While waiting for my mana to top off, I tried to remember all sorts of spells that Harry - err, that I could come up with on my own.

···

After maybe an hour or so, I headed back to where the others were. I spent the entire time testing out my abilities and limitations. In between, I had to wait for my mana to recover. Apparently, it was supposed to be slower than Stamina regen of seconds to minutes but faster than Health regen of hours to days. For a Mage, it inched quite close to Stamina. All according to Betty, of course. I couldn't get my Status Window to show actual values. In fact, I had trimmed it further. Removed all attributes - I could feel their effects anyway, and rearranged the status points. I also added a list of spells I had in my repository.

Yep, I decided to have only two spells for now. Not that I couldn't come up with others, but since I didn't have a way to comment out stuff, it seemed a bit hazardous to have untested lethal contraptions ready to release on a word readily available.

I also learned quite a few things about magic and spell casting. One couldn't directly change the core stats and attributes of a target. Setting HP to zero in one spell would've turned me into the fabled One Spell Man. Too bad. Also, my range was about 2 meters radius, centered around me. Depending on the factors involved, I could either fully cast a spell or not cast it at all. No half measures. I tried freezing a large region of land as an Area of Effect attack. No luck. Good thing though, all spells took the same amount of mana, irrespective of the target, given that they could be affected. A blade of grass, piece of a boulder and a grain of sand - all took 280 MP on Incendio, even though the effects were dramatically different on each.

As I exited the choke point and traveled across the bridge, I eventually sighted my accomplices. A few colored puddles were splashed about as if a painter had upended his paints in frustration. Up ahead, I saw one unlucky slime being whaled on by Taro, Divin, and Carol with their respective blades. Julie was standing back with the bow in one hand and a loose arrow in another, staring intently but with no apparent intention of firing. Wise choice I suppose, given her aim. Arya was standing beside Julie watching the spectacle. She noticed me as I made my way over and waved her hand awkwardly. I stood silently by their side, becoming a part of the audience. "Any luck with the spell?" she asked. "Oh, you have no idea!" I replied with a smirk.

## Chapter 5 - Slime Fest

While seemingly magical, slimes were no better than beasts when it came to intellect. They were attracted by sound (or vibrations, to be precise) and attacked in a variety of ways, usually depending on their size. The golf ball-sized ones tried to trip you by spreading at your feet. Mostly though, they fled confrontation. The slightly larger ones - about the size of basketballs, bounced at you every now and then while fleeting in and out of your range. The larger ones, the size of large dogs and over, simply tried to crush everything in their path. Perhaps consume the target with the intention of suffocating them. We hadn't encountered anything larger than a pony. The most dangerous ones of the bunch were the bouncy balls, their speed and hit were no joke. At least the larger ones were sluggish and smaller ones inconsequential. Thankfully, we hadn't encountered any actual magical slimes. Like fire-wielding ones. Hell, there weren't any acidic or poisonous ones either. All they had was physical attacks. Pure XP grind.

The slimes were also immune to physical damage. Until you hit their "core", that is. Their death transformed them into puddles. No one had yet tried pure magic on them; magical skills though did seem to damage them. Divin had a skill that did freeze damage with a slash of his sword. It was currently the group's trump card to slowing a slime down just enough to allow Taro to pierce its heart. Taro had a skill that sharpened his strikes. Julie laid the bait, Carol ran interference. Surprisingly, Arya was the busiest of all! After our small chat, having recovered her mana, she dived back into the slaughter and spread her hands in front of Taro. A glowing light around his bruised elbow indicated she was healing him.

Just as the healing stopped, Carol pushed the slime in Divin's direction. He froze it with a large swing. Taro took the opportunity to crack the fist-sized core and add a new pinkish puddle to the palette. They all came back, probably to recover their stamina while Julie went on to collect her arrows. I decided to have a go at the next slime.

···

"Damn, how many did you get already?" (Me, admiring the polychrome ground after everyone had gathered around)

"Oh, quite a few. Got some experience points as well!" (Carol, with a slight smile)

"Not enough though. The points are spread among all four of us and one slime doesn't give out that much in the first place." (Julie, with a sigh)

"Four of you...?" (Me, confused)

"Yeah, I don't attack the slimes. I mostly heal others." (Arya, looking ashamed for some reason)

"And yet you have the most experience points of any of us!" (Taro exclaimed)

"Well, as I said, that is simply because I am doing so much healing; all on my own too!" (Arya defended)

"Out of curiosity, how much point have you guys gained?" (Me)

"I've got 36" (Taro) "32 here" (Carol) "29 for me" (Julie) "35" (Divin, after a while)

"..." (Everyone staring at Arya again)

"Oh, fine already. Jeez. I've got 67 now, OK?" (Arya)

"And I'm zero" (Me, in a slightly lower voice, mostly to myself) "Hey, how did you figure out how to heal?" (directed at Arya)

"Oh, it's a skill I have. Named 'Heal', haha" (Arya, chuckling) "I kinda just figured it out"

"Interesting. How much mana does it take?" (Me, slightly sullen about her intuitive knowledge)

"Oh, about 80. I can cast 3 in a row then I need to recover" (Arya)

"I see. Anyway, guys, I was wondering if I can have a go at the next slime first? Wanna try out a couple of spells" (Me, looking around)

"Sure" "OK" "Hmm" (Positive grumbles all about)

···

Betty had merged back into one. Julie was standing at the front, looking for a suitable slime to lure. I was a couple of meters behind her. Taro, Carol, and Divin were spread out behind me. Arya was at the end. Betty's light was visible beyond Arya's head, giving her a divine halo.

Soon enough, Julie released her bowstring. An arrow went and landed beside a smallish slime. Big enough to fit five tennis balls, I suppose. It rolled towards the arrow. As it was about to reach it, Julie let out another one, this one about halfway between the first and us. Another couple of arrows brought the slime within our striking distance. Julie retreated while I and the three behind me took her place.

Mana? Check. I raised my palm to the slime headed for my legs. Target selected? Check. I exhaled out stale air and filled my lungs with fresh oxygen. 'Incendio' - a slight whisper, no more. Perhaps the slime heard me? It stopped moving for a second. It then twitched and seemed to swell to twice its size. And then it popped. Even made a "pop" sound. Its core exposed to the world, still rolling on the ground towards us carried by momentum. The rest of its remains lay steaming on the ground.

I was dumbstruck. The others were no better off. They were looking at the core with mouths agape, shell shocked. I looked at my Status Window to make sure it really was my spell that did the trick. It was. All my mana was gone. Squaring the temperature rarely worked on anything bigger than a cat-sized object and it sucked all 800 points of my mana. Even on a small object, it was a hit and miss. True gamble, to be honest. Yet against the ill-fated slime, it was perfect. 'Whilst immune to physical damage, they are extra vulnerable to magical attacks, huh?' I surmised.

"Um, shouldn't we break the core?" I eventually asked. Carol moved as if in a daze and stabbed it with a dagger. My Status Window showed I had earned 11 experience points. Everyone seemed to wake up from their dreams, with varied expressions on their face.

"Man, what was that? Incendio? OP skill man, how much mana does it take?", Taro was excited beyond words. "It takes all the considerable mana I have. It's not a skill though, more of a spell" I replied, arguing semantics for no reason. "Still, it was awesome!". 'I agree, it was.' "Now we don't have to stab one a billion times to kill it. That is some nice spell" Julie interjected. 'I agree, it is'. "Did you all get experience points from that one as well?" I asked. "Nah, only I got 'em", Carol said, "only 3 though. Since you did the most damage. You gotta contribute to the fight somehow to get some, even if you don't directly hit anything. You get points according to your contribution." she concluded. "So, you guys still have to fight then" I wondered aloud. "Yes", Divin said, "but it is different now. First, we all will take shots at it. Then you pop it. Then one of us finishes it off. Much more efficient". I was of the same mind. That being said, I can't be out of the fight after a single spell - one that may or may not even work. I decided to revert to my temperature double for the time being. If I paced myself properly, I could fight continuously for however long my mana and stamina held. 'Perhaps one spell every couple minutes. Yeah, that would work.'

···

With that, we all went on a rampage. While Incendio still popped the smaller ones, it turned the mid-sized ones into a more liquidy state from their semi-solid sludge one. The larger ones seemed to shrug it off though. But I had another spell. I had tweaked this one as well; reducing temperature to zero worked even more infrequently than squaring it. I simply halved it instead. It did not freeze them but slowed them all considerably. We were never swamped. Julie lured in a bunch of slimes at once, we fought on multiple fronts and gained experience at an accelerated pace.

No one knew how much time went by. The sky was still dusky. We weren't hungry or thirsty, let alone sleepy. Whenever we felt a bit tired, we took time out and capped off our stamina points. Then back into the fight. Julie could now hit a slime once every 5 tries. Divin and Taro's slashes were getting slightly more precise as if they had gotten hang of the swords' weight. Carol was getting slightly better at evading jumpy slimes while kiting them. Arya had managed to find a good pace of healing, that required the least amount of rest in between. The bouncy balls did the most damage, but it was limited to small bruises. Must have been several hours at least. Some of the earlier puddles had vanished. We only noticed it because there were patches of brown grass where supposed colorful ponds were meant to be. I hadn't experimented with any more spells so far. While the fight was not exhausting physically, it was draining in an entirely different way. If we had a 'mental capacity' point, we would all be very low on it. It was in this situation that Arya suddenly exclaimed - "Guys? I just leveled up"

## Chapter 6 - Level Up

We had gathered around Arya, as she stood scrutinizing her updated Status Window. When she was done, we all looked at her expectantly.

"Well, there isn't much actually. Nothing new" she grumbled, "I just got an extra point on all my attributes. My stats have increased a bit as well. That's all."

"No new skills?" Taro asked. "None" she replied.

"What about a class upgrade? Did you get that?" I questioned. She replied in a negative. 'On second thoughts, what is a class upgrade anyway?' Apparently, Divin thought the same, as he questioned Betty about it. "So what *is* as a class upgrade and when do we get it?"

Betty's wispy form shone brightly for a split second, then she said, "Where a Level Upgrade is a quantitative change in your Class, a Class Upgrade is a qualitative one. There are 5 upgrades that you can get every 5 Level Ups starting with Novice at Level 0, Competent on Level 5, Proficient on Level 10, Expert on Level 15, finally Master on Level 20."

"So... All we get are extra points on Level Ups? And what do you mean *qualitative change*?" Julie asked.

"Yes, Level Ups affect only your attribute points. Generally, you get plus one on every attribute; however, depending on your Special Effects, it may be incremented or decremented further. While it does *look* like a numerical change, it has many subtle effects that I recommend you explore on your own. As for the Class Upgrades, they are heavily dependent on what Class and Special Effects you have in place and produce a distinct change in your Status. It would take quite a while to list all possibilities. I am sure you will understand when you undergo the same." Betty concluded.

Arya suddenly exclaimed, "She's right. Even if it's just a plus one in numbers, it changes a lot of things. I just tried casting a Heal and not only can I cast it from further away, but it also takes less mana! Now that I have more mana as well, I can go on with very short breaks, basically healing continuously!"

···

Our short interlude soon came to a head and we got back into the fight. Many of us were close to leveling up now. Half the field was clear of slimes as well! I popped a murky slime trying to trip Carol, froze another trying to latch onto Taro, and took a step back to get a broader view of the fight. Divin and Julie were doing fine on the left. Arya kept her distance, so she was safe for now. The freeze spell was handy; it cost a bit less mana at 240 and was quite effective at slowing the bouncy balls down for a while. The frozen slime eventually shivered a bit and got back to bouncing on Taro. I froze it again so Taro could get a clear shot at the core, and that's when it happened. I don't know *how* it happened. But I knew - I had leveled up. It certainly was a surprise to me, given I was behind everyone in XP at the start.

"Guys, I leveled up as well! I'm gonna go take a look at my stats", I said and retreated, after ensuring they didn't need my support. Not much I could do on low mana anyway. The others continued on their fight; I noticed Julie didn't draw any more slimes towards us.

I ran back way behind even Arya and opened my Status Window. I had hidden my attributes previously, so I made them visible again and saw what had changed.

---

| Attributes   | Points |
| --------     | ------ |
| Strength     | 2      |
| Vitality     | 2      |
| Agility      | 2      |
| Dexterity    | 3      |
| Intelligence | 10     |
| Perception   | 3      |
| Wisdom       | 3      |

---

'I see, plus one on each. Nothing more, nothing less. Not surprising, I suppose.' I thought. I hid them again and went back to my Status Window.

---

'Ugh, I understand my low SP. Never was high on endurance training. But only 120 HP!?! I'm pretty sure everyone else has way more than me. So XP is down to 0 again, eh? Makes sense.'

I made my way back to the scene of the fight. Divin and Julie were about to finish off a bluish head-sized slime while Carol and Taro were nipping at another. Arya was healing a wound on Carol's shoulder, at least whenever she paused from hopping about. I stood there, pensively watching the fight waiting for my stats to recover.

···

I got back in the fight again, after we all had another break to recover. I noticed that my spells were taking about 10 less mana. With the increased mana pool, I could now cast 3 successive incendios and still have some mana left. Neat!

Another few hours went by in a flash. Fight, recover, repeat. The rest of the merry band had leveled up as well. Despite that, we didn't change our strategy. It was working, and it was working *well*.

While the cheer brought by our level-ups kept our stress at bay for a bit, it could only hold for so long. I was wondering how far we would make it when Julie sighted the exit. 'Good eyes on you, Miss Archer. Wait, does she have a skill that lets her see far away or something?' I pondered as I tried to make out the exit myself.

I saw it. Another damn bridge. Well, at least this one was wider than the makeshift ledge the last one was. I was puzzled as to why it was called a Dungeon when there were no stairs going up and down anywhere.

We eventually made our way there. Not only were all of us level 1s, but some of us were also halfway to level 2 - myself included. The field was mostly clear of slimes, a few still meandering at the edges. While the ground seemed psychedelic with color nearer to us, further on, it was returning to its natural color. It was a brown blur back where we had started from. We gazed at the ground where we had spent however many hours fighting magical ooze of fantasy, then turned our back on the fields that granted us our first level up. Fingers crossed for many more to come!

## Chapter 7 - Settling down

"'Twas my little brother's 14th birthday the day after tomorrow. I was gonna bake him a cake." Carol said.

We were all resting on the bridge, sitting down, and coming to terms with our current predicament. When we first appeared here, we were confused. Soon we got busy hunting slimes. Now that we had a moment to reflect, the reality hit us like a freight train.

"What sort of cake?" I asked just to keep the conversation flowing.

"A cheesecake, perhaps. My mum was set on Strawberries though", she chuckled. I sniggered as well, more out of formality than amusement.

The conversation would have died then, if not for Julie. "My boyfriend and I were going to visit my folks. I was going to introduce him. I was quite nervous; we were going steady and I really wanted them to all like each other. Guess that's one thing I don't have to worry about anymore". She chuckled as well. I decided not to add my formal snigger this time.

"Well, you'll have to worry about it as soon as we go back", I tried to cheer her up. Julie looked at me confused. Even the others did the same.

"You do know where we are, right? We've been here for what, a few days already? I don't know how fu+king long this test run is going to last but what I do know is that Jake isn't gonna wait decades for me to come back" Julie said, with barely concealed anger and sadness.

"Didn't you hear what Betty said? Time flows differently here and back home." I asked. Then I remembered that I was the one who had asked the question and received an answer. Others probably didn't catch on it. "Isn't that right Betty? What exactly is the time difference between the simulation and the real world?" I turned to the ball of light in our midst.

"Every month in the Simulation is a second in your world. And every month in the Tutorial is a second in the Simulation", she intoned.

"See? Our time in the Tutorial scarcely counts back home. Once we complete the Tutorial and find an exit back home, barely a second or two would have passed", I concluded. I also wondered how many humans these guys must have kidnapped and tested on out here. Time dilation was quite convenient.

The conversation tapered off after that. This time though, the people did less wallowing in self-pity and more figuring out how this new information affected their situation. The way I saw it, it didn't really matter how long we spent inside the Simulation. Even if we spent 100 years inside, back home barely 20 minutes would've passed. Not that it mattered to me. I hated being pushed around by others. Become a guinea pig for some weird test? Fu+k that! I was gonna bug out ASAP.

···

I wasn't particularly thirsty. But for some reason, I craved water. Never in my life had I been through such an onerous exercise and did not need a drop of water. It felt weird. I also wanted some food. Not that I was hungry. I wondered how long it had been since I last ate. In fact, I asked Betty, "Hey Betty, how long have we been in this Tutorial?". She replied "16 hours and 43 minutes". 'Not even a day has passed? I felt like I've been here for eons! Damn'

The others were shocked as well. Taro had a particularly funny look on his face. 'Time dilation affects us mentally too, eh?' I joked to myself.

We had been here for a while. Our clothes were clean as if new. The slime remains worked surprisingly like dry cleaning. The sky was still dark of dusk. Some stars really would've been nice, it gets damn depressing looking up to nothing. I wished we had a fire going. Not that I was cold. The temperature was just right. Since none of us was a craftsman nor had we any clue otherwise of how to start a fire without wood, we just laid about like drunken sailors, sitting with our backs against the railings in the middle of the bridge.

The entrance of the next "level" was visible ahead, although I couldn't peer past it to see the terrain. While we were resting, I opened my Status Window and decided to write some more spells. I still remembered Betty's float spell, so I decided to emulate it.

---

```
incendio o = (o.temperature = o.temperature * 2)

petrificus_totalus o = (o.temperature = o.temperature / 2)

float o = ((o.elevation + 1) * 2)
```

---

While I had no control over gravity yet, doubling the elevation should be enough. Added one in case the elevation was zero. 'Anyway, let us test' I thought and pointed my palm at a nearby pebble. "Float", I said, as quietly as possible so I didn't disturb others from their ruminations, and the pebble moved. In place. It barely left the ground. 'So gravity is still pulling it down eh?', I thought, 'No leviosa for me today!'. With a though, the float spell was removed. I wasn't that bummed about the failure, I even sort of expected it. I asked Betty if she had any other spells. Affirmative. I asked if could she upload them to my repository. Negative. Apparently, it was a one-time thing. I asked if she could *cast* any of her spells. Negative on that one as well. She wasn't able to cast spells outside of Spawn Point. I briefly considered going back but then decided against it. It's not like she said she would cast them there just for me, what if that was a one-time thing as well?

I decided I'd rather catch a shut-eye, even if I didn't need it. I closed my eyes against the gloomy dark and made myself as comfortable as possible on the hard stone. I couldn't sleep right away, I never did anyway even back home. Everyone had quieted down. Silence reigned for a while. Soon I heard heavy breathing coming from Divin's side. I even perceived someone sniffling softly. I decided to feign sleep until I actually did.

···

Julie was the first to move. "We should get going", she said. Probably more for her own sake than others. We all got up. There was no way but through.

While it was true that we didn't *need* sleep when speaking in terms of stats and points, but as humans, it certainly helped a lot. Of course, we didn't wake up filled with happiness or anything of the sort. Things just seemed... More manageable, somehow. No one commented on Carol's puffy eyes. I personally felt slightly chipper now than I did before.

As we reached the entrance, Betty's light casting long shadows ahead of us, a sight of ruin welcomed us. It was literally, a ruin. Alabaster statues with missing heads decorated the buildings made of tilted pillars and broken walls. I couldn't see how far this ruin extended, the decaying structures blocked my view further.

Suddenly, I noticed movement in the corner of my eye. I focused on it and saw a solitary vine swinging down. "Monkey?" Taro questioned no one in particular. "Yeah, it looked like a baboon", Julie answered. I must've missed it. 'Monkey ain't that bad, right?' I thought.

That was when Betty decided to make an announcement: "This is Level 1 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Imp Ruins!"

## Chapter 8 - Impish Impulse

Slimes were one thing, they felt more or less like jelly in motion. Stabbing monkeys to death was a different matter, however. No one took the initiative to step forward. I noticed several more of our supposed prey gathering ahead of us on a precariously upright wall. Taking a closer look, I noticed some differences in their physiology that made it harder for me to call them just monkeys. Especially the small leathery wings on their back. While our party stood at an impasse, more of these "imps" had gathered around.

There must've been around eight of these critters staring down at us when a slightly larger one of them dropped down to the ground. It took a couple steps towards us. We were perhaps 15 meters away from it. The attention of all the members, both human and imp, was focused on this particular pioneer. I was wondering what it was trying to do. 'Perhaps sniff for snacks?'. I was immediately proved wrong when it picked up a small rock. Before any of us could register what was happening, it swung its hand and the rock came sailing at Taro's face. Thankfully, the rock whizzed past his head and plopped harmlessly into the ground behind. I looked at Taro, then I looked at the imp. It was still standing there as if waiting for our reaction. It certainly got one.

Julie notched her arrow and fired at the culprit. Of course, it was never going to hit, but the imp didn't know that. Neither did its friends on the wall. They skedaddled out of the clearing faster than you could say imp. In that regard, they did comically seem like monkeys.

···

As time went by, the varmints grew bolder. There were over 20 of them now, taking turns throwing rocks at us while the rest egged them on. Julie stopped shooting at them after her seventh arrow. According to her, it was a waste of arrows against such numbers. I think it had more to do with how they cackled when her last arrow had hit a pillar far away from any of them. All seven of her arrows now had new owners, being held like short spears and used to poke the poor plebeians who didn't have one.

We were stuck. Sometimes Taro and Carol threw rocks back. At first, the imps were guarded. Then they guffawed at the rocks as well. While they didn't exactly mount an attack on us, we couldn't go ahead anyway. Not unless we wished to get stoned to death halfway through. Perhaps a craftsman would've been useful here, making traps and lures.

'Traps, eh?', a sudden idea hit me. I gathered the group around and explained the process. I could see the poorly hidden doubt in their dubious faces. Still, no one else had any better solution, so we decided to give it a go. We had already lost seven arrows, what does one more matter?

···

It was again the pioneer imp that took the initiative. So far, the distance between us and the imps had been constant. But now it couldn't maintain the same anymore. All of its friends had arrows of their own, whereas the who took the first step was still empty-handed. It didn't sit well with the imp. Now its greed overwhelmed its caution. We must've seemed harmless enough anyway, what with our misguided arrows and unenthusiastic rock throws.

It ambled towards the arrow stuck deep into the earth. Perhaps only a centimeter of it was visible above. The imp knew it was a shiny arrow though, for it had seen us bury it not so long ago. All of us had even retreated from the spot, now standing further back almost behind the entrance, watching the show. Well... Not all of us. Carol stood all by her lonesome behind a decrepit pillar by the side. Perhaps she was trying to hide? Either way, the imp didn't give Carol more than a glance. It was confident in its ability to run away at the slightest of sounds. And the larger group was in its sight anyway. Nothing stood between it and the arrow.

Soon it reached the spot and gave a tug at the stem. It looked us over to make sure we hadn't made a move. We hadn't. It then tugged harder. Not enough. It tried to use both hands. No grip. Soon, it was apparent that pulling the thing out wasn't gonna work, so it quickly set to digging. After giving us a cautionary glace of course. Unfortunately for the imp, it hadn't noticed Carol moving out from behind the pillar. She was using her skill of silent footsteps. I had also cast incendio on her dagger - twice. After freezing the lump of ground holding the arrow, that is.

I was actually impressed by how firm Carol stayed, given that she was about to stab the primate in the back. She reached from behind the imp, which was still engrossed in clawing out cold soil. It also ignored the pandemonium its brethren were making, perhaps mistaking it for encouragement. So lost was it in the task, that it didn't notice the dagger until it was out poking through its chest. The girl certainly didn't take half measures. The blade had cut clean through.

I had a cognition that my XP stash had increased. I would've checked the Status Window to confirm, but the scene that was unfolding held my full attention. The imp fingered the point of the dagger, then touched the end of the arrow longingly. Not a moment later, it slumped down with a confused mewl. Interestingly enough, there was not a drop of blood. The imps fur changed as if it had caught fire, originating from the wound. The fire then went on to consume the whole body, leaving but a pinch of dark ash behind, which soon scattered in the non-existent wind.

···

Nobody moved for several seconds. The imps had ceased their uproar as if on cue. Carol stood looking down at her dagger. If there had been wind here, one could've heard a whoosh sound. And then everyone moved at once. A few imps screeched loudly and made for Carol, who was about to pick her dagger up. The rest ran back to wherever they came from. We made a dash for Carol as well, shouting warnings at her. Unlike the dead imp though, she didn't ignore her companions. Didn't even look back. She ran towards us as soon as the dagger was in her hand.

Must've been about 6 imps. Perhaps they were close friends and family of the pioneer. The madness and rage in their eyes was certainly a sight to behold. Just as Carol joined us, she turned back again and we clashed with the incoming gamins. I had recovered just enough mana to freeze three of them. Taro, Divin, and Carol engaged the other three. While we certainly weren't experts at combat, we had recent experience being swarmed. Our previous foes were even immune to physical damage. And these imps weren't thinking straight. All they had was their ferocity and slightly sharp claws. Everything else was working against them. Numbers, equipment, range, power, we outmatched them in all. It wasn't long before one went down, then another, and another. I hadn't even recovered mana to cast another spell when the last one was ablaze.

I noticed that the damage, shallow though it was, was quite extensive. We had scratches all over our limbs, Carol even had some on her face. To say it was uncomfortable was an understatement. 'I hope we don't catch some weird disease' I pondered. Arya took her sweet time healing us all. Several times, she had to cast heal multiple times on a single wound. That being said, it was quite magical in the way it healed. Not a single blemish remained as if the wounded had never existed. 'It *is* magic though' I contemplated, as I mulled over our the Status Window and XP gains from the fight.

## Chapter 9 - The Unknown

We moved on with our expedition. Our M.O. was to seek open spaces in between the ruins so that the imps couldn't ambush us. When there were enough gathered, we would lay our arrow trap and lure one in. They fell for it every single time. Perhaps they were blessed with primate instincts, yet I couldn't help but wonder at their absolute lack of learning. Or perhaps the arrows were simply too tempting. Either way, Carol would assassinate the courageous one, while the rest quickly took care of the following enraged family. I had stopped casting spells on the ground and dagger, it didn't help much.

About halfway through the ruin - well I assumed it was halfway because we were walking on for what seemed like a day, the whole process of luring, assassinating and eventual chaos of blades and claws got so repetitive that Julie and I were having a casual conversation while the rest were in the midst of another broil.

"...oh, so how did you and Jake meet?" I asked.

"It's not that interesting or romantic as you might expect. We were both interns at the same firm. One day he just asked me out of nowhere; I said yes, and so it began!" Julie replied with a nostalgic smile.

"It's hard to find someone so compatible. But Jake and Julie, even your names have a nice rhythm of sorts. J and J!" I made a stupid observation, eyeing the glow on Divin's wrist that was being healed by Arya just outside the fight.

"Well, my name isn't actually Julie. In German, it comes out something close to Hulia, but I doubt you guys could pronounce it" she said while putting the arrow in her hand back inside the quiver. The fight was coming to an end.

"I'll stick to Julie, no problem. By the way, my name isn't Pat either" I said with a mysterious smile. Julie looked at me with a smile of her own and asked, "Oh, what is it then?". "Ah, you probably won't be able to pronounce it either" I smirked, opting to extend the mystery. The rest of the gang had returned by then.

···

"It has been 3 days, 2 hours and 13 minutes since we began from Spawn Point" Betty replied to a question from Julie.

'So we've been wandering these ruins for a better part of 2 days? Wow.' This time, it certainly did feel like it. The imps came at us sporadically, unlike the constant churn of slimes. I was mostly relegated to the rear position now since my contribution to the fight was limited to cold spell at the start. The imps usually died out before I could recover my mana. Interestingly enough, incendio did not seem to affect them as much as petrificus did. I couldn't figure out why exactly.

The mêlée combatants of our group were raking in XP. I bet Carol must have gained several times than the rest with her solo kills. Oh, the rest didn't include Arya, she was an outlier. I was proved correct soon when she leveled up again. I checked my Status Window, I still needed about 55 XP. At least I was ahead of Julie. Not that it mattered, I doubt we'd leave anyone behind. 'Would we not, if it really came to it?' I wondered.

It must've been our twelfth ambush when I noticed something that hadn't happened before. A particularly large imp, largest so far, had decided to have a go at the arrow. When Carol jammed her dagger into its throat, it was momentarily aflame like normal, but it didn't leave behind just ashes. When the flames died out, we saw an old boot lying on the ground. 'Is that a monster drop?' I was amazed. This was so game-like. I did not, however, put the old boot into my inventory. First, I didn't need it. Second, I had no inventory box. The others ignored it as well, after the initial curious glance or two. The incoming horde of imps also demanded our attention.

···

"My major is Environmental Science. I wanna be part of this community, ya know? Have people come together, help each other out. That is the end goal anyway. Planting some trees is a part of the journey; making our planet greener is not such a bad idea after all." Carol answered to my question about her studies and activities.

"So, which university in Ireland do you go to?" I continued. "Ah, ya know. I am *from* Ireland, but my college is in the England. I've been staying there since last year" she said. "Cool... What about you Arya, what do you do?" I turned to Arya. Julie, Taro, and Divin where on a lookout of sorts. They were also verifying our heading, making sure we weren't going around in circles. Since it was troublesome for only one to go, we had split up in 2 groups. Arya, Carol, and I were holding the fort with one half of Betty. Also, Arya was healing our minor wounds from a recent scuffle. "I'm a fashion designer", she said. Arya wasn't as tight-lipped as she was before. Now that I looked at her closely, she was quite pretty as well. "Artistic eh? Nice." I said. While I noticed a small scratch on the back of my hand mend, Carol asked Arya about her hometown. "Oh, I'm from Canada. Well, technically, I was born in India, but my family moved to Canada when I was 6. Been there for almost 20 years now."

'Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia' I guess we're missing members only from Australia. I doubt Antarctica would be considered anyway. Uniform distribution, for sure. "So you're a Programmer then?" Arya brought me out of my contemplation. "Ah yes, I work as a Software Developer", I said. "Then, can I ask you for a favor?" Arya said in a slightly flustered tone. "Oh, of course. What is it?" I said. I could already imagine what it could be. "I want to learn how to create customized spells. I gather you've already created a couple. How hard is it?" she asked, growing quite interested. "Well, it's not hard in the sense of creating one. It's more a matter of information shortage that holds you back here." I said. I wondered if I could've worded it better. I tried again, looking at her confused expression. "I mean, it is easy to write a spell, as long as you have the information you need to write one. It's like... Well, writing a recipe. Writing the recipe itself is not the problem. The issue is we don't know what ingredients we have" I explained. "So how do we find the ingredients?" came the obvious question. "Now that... That is a very good question".

···

We ran some experiments. While Carol had the tilde symbol in her Status Window as well, it was greyed out and barely visible. She couldn't open the terminal. Arya, on the other hand, could. I had her type in incendio with her mind. That was it though. She couldn't cast the spell. We enquired Betty about the same. Apparently, Healer Class did not have access to the temperature of a target. All their spells had to target HP, MP or SP in one way or another, without directly modifying them or something like that. The fact that changing temperature could affect HP was immaterial, a minor side effect. I couldn't figure out this weird restriction, wondering how her 'Heal' skill worked. I felt like I was missing something. Upon further experimentation, it was revealed that we also didn't have access to the source code of the skill. Basically, we were stuck.

While Arya was trying out random things in her terminal, the other group and Betty's other half came back. I could sense the excitement from their faces. Even the ever stoic Divin had a slight curve to his lips. My curiosity was eventually sated when Taro exclaimed - "We found the exit!"

## Chapter 10 - Id

A few more tussles and all of us reached level 2, Julie and myself being the last. No significant changes to my stats, except my mana reached 920. Quite the uneven distribution. First I got 80 mana off single intelligence point, and now only 40? There wasn't even any change in mana consumption. Still took 230 & 270 mana points for petrificus_totalus and incendio respectively. I couldn't comprehend the scale. Betty's explanation wasn't any more helpful.

Since we were already at the exit, we decided to march ahead. We were again blessed with a bridge over an abyss. Looking over the railing, Taro asked, "How deep do you think it goes?". "Perhaps it never ends" I added my two cents.

"It has to end somewhere, right?" he countered. "Well, not necessarily. Maybe it loops back out top from the bottom?" I argued. "It can do that?" he exclaimed, wide-eyed. "Sure, I like to think that is how our real Universe is. When you reach the end, you just portal back. No real end or start." Speaking of the "real" world, in however obtuse words, brought a wave of sombreness over us. No one spoke after that, as we crossed the bridge over to level 2.

···

As we graced the entrance of Level 2 we were treated to a landscape filled with hills and caves. I was filled with dread, remembering the movies based on this exact terrain. Hopefully, the denizens of the movie were not haunting these lands. Again, I couldn't see the end. Perhaps this time, it was actually far off. Nor could I see any movement. Not that that was good news.

This time, Carol took the initiative. She decided to silent her footsteps and tentatively went ahead scanning around in all directions. While I wasn't going to suggest the girl go ahead and check for monsters, as a scout, I guess that was her prerogative. Wise, even. No one spoke out loud but gave their silent consent. She advanced about 10 meters ahead of us. Baby steps now, can't have her go out all alone, scout or not.

Suddenly Betty announced, "This is Level 2 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Kin of Sobek". The kin of what now? And why did she announce it now? We hadn't even seen anything. Wait. 'Maybe she doesn't announce it when we see something. Maybe she does it when *somethings sees us*!' We stopped walking. Carol was shaking like a leaf, having come to a similar conclusion, I deduced. Or perhaps she knew what a Sobek was? I wanted to ask Betty what it meant, but I was too busy scanning for the thing, praying it won't come out of the ground or something. Just as I was about to suggest moving on, Julie screamed and took off back to the entrance. Everyone panicked and made a mad dash behind her. Soon enough we were back, poor Carol sweating from head to toe. "What the hell?" she screamed between quick pants.

···

"A large crocodile!?!" We were all aghast. "Yes, it was looking at us from the shadows in the cave off to the left. I'm sorry, I was just so scared. It looked right at me!" Julie described, now considerably calmer.

"How many did you see?" Divin asked. It certainly wasn't a good idea to be swarmed by large crocodile monsters. "Ah, I saw only one and then I ran. I don't know if there were more" Julie replied.

No one suggested going back to check. We just stood there, perhaps gathering courage. I certainly was in no hurry to become a crocodile hunter. I'd seen on TV how powerful their jaw strength was, bursting watermelons like balloons.

So we decided to take a short break there. We could make a routine of taking short naps on bridges hanging over nothingness. I wasn't in any mood to sleep, my time in Level 1 was more or less relaxed. So I opened up my Status Window and decided to go through another trial and error session.

···

'So, everything in this simulation is an object and I can directly mutate their values. Of course, there are permissions and privileges, dos and donts but the fact still remains. I wonder if I can print the objects somehow? That would be an awesome push to my progress!'

Since the function definition looked like Haskell, I decided to try out one of its inbuilt function.

```hs
print_object o = (id o)
```

'OK, let's try this'. I lifted my hand and pointed to a pebble. "Print object", I whispered. Nothing.

'Perhaps it takes in console.log?' I tried out several variations. 'Nope. Hmmm, what if...?' I modified the program.

```sh
print_object o = (echo o)
```

This time, I lost 45 mana. And a new window overlapped my terminal.

---

### Rubble

---

'Hallelujah, this damn thing takes shell commands. Woo!!!' I was excited beyond measure. I again suppressed my urge to do a victory dance. Arya, however, noticed. "You're doing your weird smile again"; she didn't stay quiet this time, opting to mutter her thoughts to me. "Ah, yes. I managed to create a new spell!" I confided. The others were resting, fitfully or otherwise. Arya came over and inquired about the new spell. I deliberated over how to best explain it to her; teaching object-oriented stuff would be a pain in the ass. I decided to change the name to help the case.

```sh
identify o = (echo o)
```

'You can get information about a thing using this spell, Identify' I said as I helped her type the code in her terminal. I didn't expect it to run, but to my surprise, it actually did! Why did identify run, when it has nothing to do with any stats? I immediately called Betty over, hissed my befuddlement, and leveled her with a cold stare. Betty replied guilelessly, "Healer class cannot directly affect HP, neither can Mage for that matter. Also, Healers do not have access to parameters that are not co-dependent on HP. The identify spell, as you can see, is not interacting with any of the object's parameters. So the restrictions do not apply." A lot to unpack there but it somehow made sense in a convoluted way. So Arya couldn't change temperature because it wasn't really dependent on HP directly. Even her 'Heal' skill worked directly on wounds. I see... 'I'll think about it some other time though. Gotta experiment with identify!' and so, Arya and I went around identifying random things. Of course, after the pebble, I ran it on her first!

'Ah, just this? I should've been able to see things like temperature as well since I can modify it. Perhaps my level is too low? Hey, at least I can see the level, class and effects. That's a good start.' Arya had her palm pointed at me as well, her eyes glassy. Soon she came back, our eyes met and she smiled at me. "This is a damn good spell!" she said. "I agree, it is" I replied, slightly puffing my chest. Identify used up 70 of her mana, where it took only 45 for me. Another interesting discovery. Eventually, I ran out of things to identify around me. Intriguingly, identify didn't work on Betty. It consumed mana, yes, but showed a blank screen.

While I wasn't really sleepy, the run back has sapped my SP. The exhaustion was catching up. So I decided to take a short nap. And that was just what I did.

## Chapter 1` - Crocodile Hunters (1)


Taro, Divin, and I were moving forward with the ladies trailing behind us at a distance. This was our new formation, where the three guys had become meat shields for some reason.

The hullabaloo of previous Levels was absent, instead filled with deceptive tranquility. Despite our strain, or perhaps because of it, we were having a light conversation. Taro had initiated it, asking me about my home town. Currently, we were on the topic of his school.

"... Oh you know, it's not like they teach anything meaningful. Plus, I had my exams coming up next week. I was summoned at a perfect time. Now I don't have to study anymore!" he grinned.

"Haha", I laughed softly, choosing not to mention the time difference again. "What about you Divin? What sort of business do you own?" I switched the conversation to Divin.

"Hmm, you know. Odds and ends..." He waved it off. "I see", I said. I didn't. Thinking about it now, on the spectrum of most talkative on the right to least on left, Divin would sit on the extreme left. Carol would probably be on the other end, followed closely by Taro. I guess Julie, myself and Arya were somewhere in between, in that order.

Pretty soon, we reached the place where we had run back from before. Looking off to the left, I scanned the caves for signs of a crocodile. I didn't have to search for long. I soon saw it, just at the mouth of the cave sitting still with its mouth wide open, half-concealed by the long shadows of evening. Forget a balloon, it could pop my head like a bubble; that is how large it was. We stood and stared at it watchfully. It didn't move a muscle.

As we stood, the girls made their way to our position. Then they gawked the reptile as well. It still didn't move. Eventually, Taro looked around the group and nodded. 'No man, don't!' I almost shouted, but I knew we had no choice. I decided to move as well, given I had the highest damage rate with my spells. I had to hit it first like I usually did at the start of every fight against monsters. Divin wavered for a bit, then joined us as well. We were back in our new formation, except this time, the girls decided to stay put. We moved on to get a closer look at our next supposed prey.

···

A very large crocodile, perhaps 6 meters in length, laid still on the ground. During our advance, it had slowly closed its large snout. If we hadn't seen it open beforehand, perhaps we would've been fooled into thinking that it hadn't moved at all!

We were about 20 meters away from it. It didn't move. We moved ahead haltingly, reaching almost 10 meters near it. 'Damn, this thing is BIG!' I thought to myself. I guessed it came close in size to some of the largest crocodiles on our planet. We stopped there, hesitant to move forward. I could now actually see the monster appraise us. There was a glint of beastly intellect in its eyes that you see only in apex predators.

I lifted my hand, hoping to get a selection. Nope. I inched closer, praying it wouldn't suddenly jump out and grab at me. I couldn't select it still, but this time, the monster moved. Ever so slowly, it lifted its front leg and moved it forward. With a characteristic flex of its body, it moved the other leg ahead. I couldn't see the hind legs, shrouded in shadow as they were. It moved excruciatingly slow. I was tense as a drawn bowstring, ready to scamper off at the slightest hint of trouble.

As we watched it amble towards us languidly, we realized that the thing moved as if in slow motion. Perhaps it was bogged down by its own weight. I still kept my hand lifted though, and perhaps it was about 6 meters away from us when I could suddenly feel something different. I was able to select it! 'Wow, my level up must've affected my range more than I thought'. I quickly cast Identify on it.

---

###  Kin of Sobek - Level ?

*Special Effect*

* Transient Life: You are a temporary variable in a short-lived calculation

---

Before I could process what was written on the screen, my caution overwhelmed my curiosity. The crocodile was no more than 5 meters ahead of me and I wasn't about to let it get any closer. With my palm already pointing at its snout - I hadn't moved it at all, I spoke in a loud voice the name of my most damaging spell - "INCENDIO!".

···

If you have ever felt stupid in life, think of what I had just done. I had cast a heat spell on a cold-blooded reptile monster when it was but a few meters away from me and heading in my direction for a light snack. The effect was immediate. It first spent a couple of seconds as if enjoying the heat spread through its thick body and then it raced towards us instantly.

I had never in my life ran faster than when I did after being chased by the crocodile monster. I gave no thought to Taro, nor to Divin. In my Usain Bolt moment, I hazily noticed that the girls were already gone. I reached the entrance within what felt like hours and seconds at the same time. The other guys were at my heels, apparently. The girls stood just beyond, panting on the bridge. Looking back, the crocodile had given up chase after barely a few meters, now languishing back in its nest; perhaps deciding to conserve its heat.

I felt ludicrous about my actions. I was also utterly drained from my sprint. I felt like the stupidest bum if there ever was one. But for some reason, I started laughing. Yes, I felt incredibly dumb. Yes, my life was in danger, if only for a couple of seconds. Yet I couldn't help it at all. I sniggered loudly, then burst into full-blown laughter. Soon, I was joined by Carol, Taro, and Arya as well. While I did not see them in my mirth, I bet Julie and Divin had grins on their faces as well.

"Well, that was stupid", I said after our giggle-fit died down. "Yeah, but at least now we have a fighting chance", Divin said. "I agree", I said thinking about how petrificus would affect these things. "So what exactly happened?" Julie asked, with Arya and Carol perking their ears. Taro took the responsibility to regale them with our hilarious and deadly adventure. Slightly exaggerating it in the process, of course.

···

'Transient Life, eh?' I thought about the special effect on the creature. 'I guess these things are explicitly created for the purpose of this tutorial. I wonder what will happen to the place after we leave?'. I asked Betty the same. "Yes, the level and monsters in it are garbage collected after you pass on to the next level", she replied, "Level 0 and 1, along with slimes and imps inhabiting them, now no longer exist."

For some reason, I felt sad about it. But then again, that is how these things work. 'Temporary variables for sure', I thought as I brooded over the matter for a while.

## Chapter 12 - Crocodile Hunters (2)

This was the second time I was dumbstruck by the sheer utility of a spell. First, when it popped the slime into a steaming nothing. Now, when it stunned a giant reptile into near immobility.

Sure, the area of effect was less. I had cast petrificus on its belly from the side while Carol distracted it from the other side. And yet, the effect was quite dramatic. Slowly but surely, it closed its eyes and shrank its legs unto itself. Like saying goodnight to the world. Desperate efforts were made on the crocodile's part to get back into the safety of its shelter, but the three blade-masters had become quite ruthless by then. Not to mention the continuous onslaught of Julie's arrows. She missed less and less the closer she dared to come to the creature.

After 3 rapid doses of my freeze spell, the thing went rigid. Its skin was thick but that only lengthened the agony. Before long, we had taken down our first crocodile monster. This was also our first fight where Arya's help was unnecessary. I doubt we would've needed her help if we had lost against that one - we would've been crushed beyond repair.

Interestingly, the crocodile did not bleed either. At least not blood. While its wounds were dark nothings, its body turned into a watery sploosh when it died. I asked Betty if all the monsters are the same. According to her, the monsters in the tutorial were specially created to be cannon fodder for the test subjects. The reason they did not bleed was so the subjects could get acclimated to killing them. Very kind of our kidnappers to worry about our mental state. The monster counterparts in the 'outer world' were quite varied. And bled when struck. If a level 2 guy like me had encountered a crocodile, like this one in its natural habitat, that would be it for me.

I opened my status window to check my gains from the kill.

'Woah, I got 32 XP for this piece of cake? 9 more crocs and I'm level 3 baby! Ah, I bet mine was the highest though, so others probably got less.'

Apparently, I was correct, but the difference in XP wasn't as big as I had imagined. Everyone received somewhere between 20 to 30 XP.

'Except Arya. I wonder how she will get to level 3 here without having to heal?'

I was looking at her as I thought that when she cast a heal upon herself. She must've noticed my questioning gaze, because she replied, "Ah, I don't have to heal actual wounds to get XP. If I just cast the spell, I get a little XP as well. It's much less, but it's something". If that is not a cheat power, I don't know what is. 'Wait, hey. Why can't I get XP when I cast my spells out of combat?'. I asked her, "Do you get XP for Identify as well?". "No, just for Heal", she said with an apologizing tone. 'Of course, it is like that. Just you wait, system, I am gonna hack the sh+t out of you.' This unfair treatment lit a different fire in my heart. It burned just as bright as the one asking me to get home. However, this one was different. It was the same one I always got when faced with a tough challenge.

'Speaking of, is there a user-based structure in this system as well? Gotta be, given how closely it resembles our world's technology. There must be root access as well'.

I decided to put the thought in the back of my mind for now. Everyone else had checked their attributes and stats as well. We decided to move on and explore the caves while our mana/sp recovered. 'If this is how the fight against every crocodile goes, then this might just be the easiest level so far', I mused.

···

The greatest difficulty in this level was not the fight against a monster; it was actually spotting one. These damn things were hibernating or something because they were never out in the open. It had been over a day and we only found 4 more crocodiles. One was halfway into the ground as if enjoying a dirt bath. It was even worse since we couldn't just run around looking for them. One snatch and grab, and we're done for.

So we moved around cautiously. Myself, Carol and Julie in the front. Flanked just behind by the rest. I did not appreciate being in the front again but I had the ability to slow down the opponent, so I did not complain. Funnily enough, the road to the next level was always perceivable. The ruins were much worse. I wondered what would happen if the Imp hordes attacked us on this terrain. We would be done for. Whoever designed this tutorial was being very generous.

Suddenly, Carol exclaimed, "There, on your right. See behind that rock? Me thinks that is a tail". She was right. Her speech was getting weirder by the minute though. Another monster was sleeping behind a rock quite close to us. As we explored the region, I had come to the conclusion that while Julie's sight was quite amazing, Carol was better at discerning things. Especially if they were close by.

Now that we had glimpsed our prey, we quickly changed formation. I still stayed at the front though. Julie and Arya moved behind the rest. Taro and Divin covered me, while Carol went ahead to do her thing.

The thing was slow to move, given how sleepy it was in the first place. Blasts from my spell brought it close to a standstill. And the others did the rest. Another one down. Honestly, it was so effortless that I had trouble believing it.

That was our 6th croc monster. I was earning XP between 27 - 33 per kill. I opened up my status again, out of habit. This time, I decided to hide even my spells and effects. It's not like they change much and I can always get them back when I wanted.

### [Novice] Mage - Level 2

| HP      | MP      | SP    | XP      |

···

It is amazing how adaptable we human beings are. The constant fight against the slime wore us down like never before. Our march through the ruins was no less strenuous. First I missed a warm bed and a hearty meal. Later, I yearned for a sip of water and just the feeling of awakening after a deep sleep. Even though I didn't need any of it. Now? It had been close to 2 days that we'd been wandering these hills. We hadn't slept *once*. Besides the short rest after killing a monster, we were constantly on the move.

That was why it wasn't long before we located the exit. This Dungeon probably went in a straight line, it seemed. We had just killed our twelfth crocodile. I reached level 3 first this time, quickly followed by the rest. Arya was still at level 2 though.

We made for the exit. Another bridge, the same as last. We went ahead and decided to rest while Arya gained her XP. I wasn't feeling like napping again. The stone floor wasn't so welcoming anyway. I decided to go for another trial and error session. This time with a different objective. I looked at Arya casting Heal on herself in succession, then waiting to recover mana. She looked at me as well, "Another spell?", she asked. "Well, not really. More like meta-spell" I answered. 'Man, I suck at explaining things'. "A meta-what?", she shot back. "How do I explain it? Umm... Well, never mind. I'll show you when I'm done", I took the easy way out. She chuckled an okay and I opened my Status Window Editor. I cracked my knuckles, cranked my neck, took a deep breath, muttered to myself 'Here goes nothing', and dived right in!


## Chapter 13 - Timing Attack

```sh
test = echo "Hello, World!"
```

"Test", I whispered. A new window opened up.

---

### Hello, World!

---

I was almost certain that it would work but still sighed in relief. Then I quickly modified the program, coming to the crux of the issue.

```sh
test = sudo echo "Hello, World!"
```

I took a deep breath. Crossed my fingers. Whispering with my eyes closed, "Test". I opened a single eye slowly and my lips unconsciously curled into a smile.

---

### Password:

---

'Hallelujah!' I celebrated in my mind. There *is* a superuser!

"So it worked?", Arya asked out of nowhere. I beamed at her blankly for a moment. "You did your devilish smile again", she clarified.

"Okay, first off, it is a normal smile. And second, yes. I got want I was looking for. As for whether I can use it or not, the jury is still out on that one", I said.

"So, can you tell me now what the spell is?", she beamed back. She was peculiarly interested in programming, given her profession. Perhaps she hoped to make a powerful resurrection spell or something?

"Okay. In computers, there is a concept of a superuser, who can do stuff normal users cannot. Ummm, for example, think of a corporate building. You have your cleaners, workers, security, and so on. Many people with various roles and access to different rooms and tools. Then there is the owner or an administrator of the building. That one has access to all the rooms and all the stuff of the building. A superuser is something like the administrator. I mean, bad example but the analogy is close enough. In Windows, the user is called an Administrator only, if I remember correctly", I tried to explain.

"Ah, I understand. So, what has your spell got to do with an admin?", she asked.

"Hmmm, well you must know by now that these spells are nothing but programs, right? If I can get superuser rights, then -"

"Then you can access tools and do stuff that you normally couldn't!", she cut me off and concluded.

"Well, yes", I replied. 'She is quick on the uptake' I thought.

"So how do you become an admin?" she quizzed.

"That is the problem. You need a password", I said with a bitter smile.

"Oh", she reflected back. "My mana is back up, I'm gonna go cast heal", she said and went back to her grind. I went back to mine.

···

'Brute force? Nah, I don't have the time. Hmm, will it be susceptible to attacks though? Even our Earth systems are so air-tight, this is an alien super system we are talking about', I was pessimistic. Good thing I had nothing but time on my hand. I decided to give it a try.

---

### Password: password

---

I added the password with a thought. The window just vanished. No 'Hello, World!'. I noticed I was down 2 mana. 'Come on, I'm not even doing anything!' I wailed.

More determined than ever, I tried several more variations. No dice.


'I can't manually keep entering a password. A few more and I'll forget what I entered previously. Nor would I be able to cover all the characters', with that thought, I decided to automate it.

```sh
test = (while(true) (echo "password" | sudo -S echo "password worked!"))
```
I cast the spell. One mana point down. I didn't see the window prompting for the password. Another second down, another mana point gone.

'What is this? A background job? I see. Since the system is unable to determine how many resources this spell will consume, it is taking it in as it requires. But this won't do. I'm checking for the same thing over and over again. I will be down to zero in fifteen minutes at this rate! And if I add checks for all combinations, god knows how long it will take', as I fretted over the issue, another idea popped into my mind. 'What if?'


```sh
test = (i = 0; while(i <= 255) (echo "$str $(time)" > file; str = getChar[i++]; echo $str | sudo -S echo $str "worked!" ))

getChar i = awk 'BEGIN{printf '%c", i}"

time = date +%s%N
