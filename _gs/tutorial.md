# Volume 1 - Tutorial

## Prologue

I opened my eyes to a dark sky. 'Not a cloud in sight, must be late at night. Oh, no stars even in this dark? Interesting...' I thought. 'Wait... Why am I looking for stars? Where the hell am I?' There was diffused lighting about, the kind you would get on a late sunny evening, but I couldn't pinpoint a source. My wandering hands found hold of dry grass beside my prone body. Now I was worried. I quickly got up and looked around. Some sort of plain landscape surrounded by what looked to be high cliffs on all sides but one. There were some people gathered there, so that was where I made my way.

As I sauntered over to the group, I saw a figure floating in the air. I did a quick double-take. 'What the hell!?!' There was a woman in Egyptian-esque costume floating off the ground, her eyes closed. Surrounded by 5 more people. Thankfully, the people were quite grounded, and looked as confusing as I felt. From the looks of it, they had gathered quite recently as well. Just as I was about to ask what the fuck was going on, the floating woman opened her eyes, looked over us all as if making sure we were paying attention, then exclaimed:

"Welcome, to the Grand Simulation!"

The Cleopatra look-alike continued after a slight pause, "Congratulations! You all have been chosen as test subjects for acceptance testing of Grand Simulation v389.12.425. My name is Betty, and I am here to answer any and all the questions you have. Please ask away!"

One of the people standing about, a tall wiry-thin blonde woman, quickly asked: "Where the hell am I?" 'Well, you took the words right out of my mouth there sister.' Betty looked at the woman and answered without missing a beat, "You are currently in the Spawn Point for test subjects. The Spawn Point is located inside the Tutorial Dungeon. The Tutorial Dungeon is located in the memory region of the Simulation itself; it is, however, removed from the space and time constraints of the main program!"

The blonde had her mouth hanging open. I noticed that after I managed to gather my own slack jaws. Before anyone else could ask anything else, I spoke up: "How do we get back home?" Betty's eyes, which were trained on the blonde so far, now bore into me. They seemed devoid of life for some reason. She spoke in her eerie voice again: "To get out of the Tutorial, and the Simulation as a whole, you must be deleted; in other words, you must die." Not only did our mouths hang open again like a sinkhole, I felt several hearts skip a beat, or perhaps just mine skipping more than once. We all looked at each other, but no one spoke for a while.

"Anoo... How are you flying?" a black-haired youth on my left asked. He had been gawking at Betty for a while. 'Quite the silver-lining kind of guy we have here; also she is not flying, just floating,' I argued uselessly in my mind. Betty turned to him in her mechanical manner - I was glad she wasn't staring at me anymore and answered: "It is a spell that inverses gravity until the mass of my body is balanced off by the pull in either direction at an elevation of 2.73 meters off the ground." While that was a lot to chew on, I immediately caught on something - 'float *SPELL*?' Apparently, the kid did as well; he was practically shaking with excitement. "*You can do magic?*" he asked with obvious excitement. She replied again - perhaps it was only me, but it looked like she was expecting this question, "Why yes! Everyone in the Simulation can cast spells and do magic. Even you! Some Classes are restricted to only using said spells while other Classes can actively tweak other spells or create new ones entirely!" 'Classes? Magic? What...?'

"Ummm... Is there any other way of getting out of this... simulation, besides, you know, dying?" a fair doe-eyed girl asked from beside the blonde. "I'm afraid there isn't," Betty replied and continued eyeing the poor girl as if mocking her. While everyone digested that, I put in another question, "What are we supposed to do here?" To which Betty replied after setting her glare on me, "First, you must complete the Tutorial to get to the base Level of human adults in the Simulation. Once you finish the Tutorial and enter the Simulation, you are free to do as you wish."

···

Betty wasn't going anywhere soon; the blonde had confirmed that with her. So here we were, introducing ourselves at blondie's insistence. She went first:

"You all can call me Julie. I'm a lawyer and I live in Berlin," she said and looked around for whoever was going next. A slightly plump girl with a reddish hair-do by her side coughed slightly to get everyone's attention.

I noticed that there were three women, all on my right, grouped up. And two guys standing some distance apart to my left. The curious kid and another slightly overweight guy. Everyone looked either around my age of mid-20s or younger. The girl continued her introduction since no one interrupted:

"I'm Carol, Irish. I am studying Uni." With that, she did a slight nod of her head and stepped back. If not for the current situations, I could see her being the life of a party, or being mischievous in general. No one spoke up next, so I did.

"Name's Pat. I'm a programmer." I said my piece and stayed silent. No point in wasting words. The curious guy went next:

"Hajimemashta, my name is Taro. I am 17 years old, a high school student from Japan." he said and glanced around with a carefree smile as if he knew some secret no one else did. 'What I'd give to know where his cheery attitude comes from!'

"Divin's the name, I am from Congo. I own a small business," said the last guy in a deep voice. The only remaining girl had the attention of us all; she didn't seem too keen on talking but spoke nonetheless:

"I am Arya," she said simply. 'To the point, are we?'

'Good, now that's done, back to getting the hell out of doge,' I thought. Apparently, so did everyone else, as we all turned back to Betty for an in-depth interrogation session. 'Please let this just be some weird dream,' I prayed. If only I knew the kind of shit I was going to end up in, I might have prayed harder, a lot harder...

## Chapter 1 - Chat Bot

"Why are we here?" (Julie)

"You all are test subjects for -" (Betty)

"No, I mean, why are *we* here? Why us?" (Julie)

"Oh, you were randomly sampled from your planet with uniform distribution of gender and location. Also, your fluency towards a common language and your age bracket favored your selection to a degree." (Betty)

"..."

"Can't you just send us back?" (Carol, looking a bit hopeful)

"I'm afraid I cannot do that." (Betty)

"How do I do magic?" (Taro, still excited)

"First, you must select a Class. There are 6 base Classes that humans can choose from, although you may choose only one; all Classes have the ability to cast magic. However, only Healer and Mage Classes can create spells on their own. Other Classes rely on their Skills to intuitively cast magic." (Betty)

"Sweet, how do I get a Class?"  (Taro)

"To get a - " (Betty)

"Wait, hold on. What the hell is this? Just how are we here? Am I dreaming or something? Why can't you send us back home? You basically kidnapped us and are now forcing us to do whatever. I want to go home!" (Me, slightly losing it)

"This is the Tutorial Dungeon. You are not dreaming. You can leave the Simulation by deleting yourself." (Betty)

"OK, so how did you bring us here? I don't remember being nabbed or anything." (Me)

"I did not bring you here, I am here just to answer your questions." (Betty)

"So... *How* exactly did we end up here?" (Arya, backing me up)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that." (Betty)

"Why not?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that" (Betty)

"Yeah I know, you just said that. I'm asking why not?" (Me, exasperated)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that" (Betty)

"..."

"She's a dammed chatbot! Just great! Stuck inside a simulation with a bunch of strangers and a smart-ass bot." (Me, mostly to myself but came out loud)

"You're a chatbot, aren't you?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot - " (Betty)

"Of course you can't..." (Me, grumbling to myself again)

"Ano... How do I get a Class again?" (Taro, looking at me as if asking me to shut up)

"To get a Class, you must open up your Status Window. You can open your Status Window by swiping up with a finger. Before you select a Class, I recommend going through the descriptions to get one most suited to yourself, as you will be stuck with that Class and its evolution tree for the rest of Simulation" (Betty)

Everyone swiped their finger in the air and got a glazed look in their eyes. I did as well, and a virtual reality type window opened up. It was empty save for two things - a "Select Class" red glowing text and a tiny tilde ~ symbol at the bottom right. I was about to click on "Select Class" when I heard Divin, who had been silent so far, speak up.

"Why are you dressed like that?" (Divin, deadpanned)

"This Simulation and everything in it has been constructed with inspiration taken from your planet's stories from the ages, be they history or fantasy. As for this particular attire, it was meant to stand out so I could attract your attention when you spawn here." (Betty)

"Is that so..." (Divin, quieting down)

Now dragged out of our concentration from admiring the Status Windows, another barrage of questions was fired at Betty.

"What about our necessities? Like food, water, and so on?" (Julie)

"You do not need sustenance in the Tutorial Dungeon. This place is outside of the main program and not subject to the same space and time constraints; as such you are exempt from hunger, thirst, and sleep for the duration of your stay. You will, however, get injured or fatigued as you expend Health or Stamina Points, and will require treatment or rest to reclaim." (Betty)

"So we just, what, finish this Tutorial and get out of here?" (Arya)

"The Tutorial aims to bring you to the baseline of an adult human in the Simulation. You may act alone, or in groups. I will, however, follow along until you have completed the Tutorial Dungeon to answer any and all questions you have. Please ask away!" (Betty)

No one asked anything. Apparently, Betty was going to stick around, or rather float around, for quite a while. We all went back to our Status Windows to read the Class descriptions.

## Chapter 2 - Class Selection

I clicked on "Select Class" text. Nothing happened. My hand went through the window. I looked at the interface for a while. I tried touching the tilde symbol. Same nothing. I looked about and saw others going through similar ordeals. Eventually, Taro whined impatiently at Betty, "Nothing is happening, my finger goes through it! How do I click on this?" Betty immediately answered, "Physical interaction with the Status Window was phased out 254 major versions ago, to 'click' on an item, simply focus on the same. While a bit unwieldy at first, statistics indicate that such interaction is 28 times more efficient than the previous one."

I focused on the text more than I normally would, and immediately the screen was replaced by a bunch of sections - six, to be precise. I slowly scrolled through each section, reading the brief description of each.

---

KNIGHT - Base Class

Knights are adept at mêlée combat; very high Strength attribute with the ability to use quick Skills in addition to a sword and keep up a good defense simultaneously.

SCOUT - Base Class

With high Agility and Stealth attributes, Scouts generally prepare for the arrival of the main party - be it by securing the route ahead or scoping out the enemy camp for potential incursion points.

HEALER - Base Class

With a good leg up on Intelligence and Endurance attributes, Healers take care of their health, and that of others, by topping it off with pre-defined Skills or customized spells.

CRAFTSMAN - Base Class

Low but well-rounded attributes, Craftsmen get an extra utility Skill on each Class Upgrade. They modify or create items, enchantments, and structures from scratch with the right materials and Skills.

ARCHER - Base Class

Focusing on Dexterity and Agility, Archers either distracts an opponent so the party can get close or goes in for the fatal shot on a distracted one, adapting to the situation as required.

MAGE - Base Class

Very high Intelligence at the cost of other attributes. Instead of getting a pre-defined Skill when leveling up, craft highly specialized and equally deadly personal spells.

---

Ha... My Class was set a while ago when Betty mentioned them for the first time. I focused on selecting that Class and the window went back to the main screen describing my Class and current status.

---

I was feeling quite good about myself. I looked around to see that others were still absorbed in their screens. I waited a minute, then another. After 5 minutes, I was quite sure something was amiss. I asked Betty about the Tutorial to while away time. According to her, there were 20 levels going down until the "Exit Portal" at the bottom. We were currently on level 0. You couldn't enter a higher level unless you were at that level or higher. She mentioned that the tutorial was tailored to get us to level 20, which was the baseline of adult humans in this (well, the "outer" simulated) world. She wouldn't go in-depth about the environment of any level and other details, so I figured it was more "explore-and-exploit" kind of thing the creators were going for. She wouldn't answer who the creators were, what or who the test was by, and for, or absolutely anything that had nothing to do with the Simulation itself. I tried several different variations but her lips were sealed tight.

This back and forth went on for another 15 minutes I reckon, when people started coming to. I looked around to hear what they had chosen. Hopefully, not everyone had chosen the Mage Class.

···

"Man, the Mage Class is so nerfed! And here I was, foolishly looking forward to it." Taro exclaimed. 'Wait, what?'

"Yeah," Carol agreed, "When I looked at the detailed description and attribute distribution, it was even below the Craftsman Class. Anyway, I chose the Scout. What about you two?" 'Heh?'

"I chose Knight," he said - as if it should have been obvious, and looked at me expectantly.

"Ummm, what do you mean when you say the Mage Class is nerfed? And what's this about attribute distribution?" I asked them instead. To which Taro replied, "Well when you focus on a certain Class, you could see in-depth information about their capabilities, roles, and growth potentials. I say Mage is nerfed because that Class does not get any Skills as other Classes do. They have to create spells on their own to use magic. Why would anyone want to do research here?" with a pause, he continued, "Also, all the attributes were lowest I could see compared to others - even craftsmen had a good 3 on most, except for Intelligence. What's the point of starting with lots of mana when you can't even use it, right? And I don't even know how one would go about building customized spells - sounds like a lot of work to me." Taro concluded. All I could think of was - 'Well, shit!'

Carol chimed in, "Yeah, I even got 3 special effects for my Class. I believe Mage had only one. What Skills did you get for the Knight, Taro?" The conversation continued; eventually, the rest of the girls joined in. Arya took the Healer Class, Julie the Archer. Finally, Divin joined in too. Apparently, he had taken the Knight Class as well. There was a bit of hubbub over there not being any Craftsman, but I was too engaged in cursing my own stupidity and impatience to notice much of what was being said at the moment.

···

After a while, I told them that I had taken the Mage Class. Thankfully, all I got were a few confused looks. It seems that the attributes were also dependent on the Class. As such, the Knight Class had a "Vigor" attribute that resulted in extra HP regeneration, while the Scout had "Stealth" attribute - I had neither. Healer had an "Attunement" that affected the rate of healing applied to others. I realized I had no clue what effects attributes had, so took another look at the Status Window, this time willing it to show me attribute description.

---

| Attribute    | Affects                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physical attack damage dealt and received |
| Vitality     | Health Points                             |
| Agility      | Physical speed                            |
| Dexterity    | Physical range                            |
| Intelligence | Mana Points                               |
| Perception   | Magical range                             |
| Wisdom       | Magical attack damage dealt and received  |

---

'I see. I have no special health regeneration; and every monster and their mother would notice me without the stealth attribute.' Others also had a "Skills" section below "Special Effects" with one Skill each already. While I was reading the attribute description, Carol was trying out a Skill to silent her footsteps. With magic. And here I was - a Mage, twiddling my thumbs. Yeah, I was pretty pissed at myself.

## Chapter 3 - Level 0

A dream is only a dream after you wake up. While you are dreaming, it becomes your reality. I believe all of us here had taken being kidnapped quite well, considering everything. At least no one broke down. I could tell Carol was putting up a brave front. Taro was actively enjoying it. Julie was still on the fence about whether to laugh or cry, but she was distracting herself by taking charge. Arya was silently sulking. I couldn't get a read on Divin though. As for me? I was wondering what my folks at home would be up to, they must've lost it by now. I decided to ask the Betty about it, not expecting an answer, "Hey, what about the people back on our planet, surely they would've noticed us missing?" Surprisingly, I got a response. "The Simulation is not subject to the space-time constraints of your world; just like the Tutorial is separate from the Simulation, the Simulation is separate from your reality." 'Ah, makes sense. It is like time has stopped there, eh?'

We gathered around Betty, ready to go where fate would lead us. Julie was just about to say something when Betty spoke up again - "So, you have all got your Classes, allow me to lend your starting equipment!" So saying, she raised her hand and down came a stream of light in front of each of us. Two swords in front of Taro and Divin, a bow and quiver full of arrows in front of Julie, a dagger for Carol and staff for Arya. I got nothing. "Ummm, my equipment seems to be missing?" I queried. "Mages don't need a physical weapon to attack," she said. 'What, are you kidding me?'. "At least, give me a dagger or something, just in case!" I begged. "I'm afraid I cannot." I looked around and got only sympathetic looks. I didn't give up though, "But I do not know any magic spells. How am I supposed to defend myself?" "I'd recommend creating a spell," she said. "I didn't really go to Hogwarts, you know. I have absolutely no clue how to go about making or using a spell!" I bit back. "While I do not have the data of how you should create your spell, I am certain you must use your Status Window to create one. For reference, allow me to upload my floating spell into your repository..."

I opened up my Status Window again and immediately noticed that the tilde (~) symbol at the bottom was bold. I focused on it and a terminal-like screen opened up. It was blank save for one line:

`float o = (while (o.elevation < 2.73) _____.gravity--)`

I was dumbstruck. 'Shit... It's a god damned program. True, it looks like an unholy union of Haskell and Javascript, with bits of Lisp and redacted stuff in between; but I recognize it nonetheless. And I actually have a shell to work on? Fucking A!' I almost did a small victory dance but contained myself hastily. My smile must have betrayed me, however, as Arya had a weird look in her eyes.

"Perhaps we should get going now?" Julie broke the awkward silence and looked at Betty. Betty didn't move a muscle. Seems like she meant it literally when she said she will be *following* us. Another moment later, Julie huffed a bit, shouldered her bow and arrows, then led the way out of the Spawn Point clearing. Just as we stepped out of the choke point leading out onto a wide road, Betty turned from Cleopatra to Will-'O-the-Wisp. It was Carol who spoke up, "Why'd ya turn into a ball of light?" to which Betty replied, "It is easier to split into multiple entities in this form, and it is also lighter on resource consumption" 'Ah, she did say she would follow us all even after we went individually. So this is how. Weird, but logical.' Apparently, Carol thought so too, because she didn't have any follow-up questions.

···

The unremarkable road eventually lead us to an unremarkable field. It was big enough to fit a couple of football stadiums. Albeit barren of any fauna, it was sprouting something oozy in large quantities. Wait, are these slimes? "What is this?" Julie enquired, motioning in the general direction of the slimes. Betty-the-wisp spoke up, "This is Level 0 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Slime Field" 'Clever naming sense there' "The entrance to Level 1 is on the opposite side of our current position; you must cross this field and reach level 1 before you can proceed to the next Level"

I looked around the field. If was filled with slimes of all sizes and colors. The one thing they all had in common was how lazily they were ambling towards nowhere in particular. I was quite absorbed in taking in the view, so I missed the moment when Taro and Julie made their move. Taro jumped ahead, sword held up in both hands in front of him, while Julie took out her bow and notched an arrow. This was when I noticed their actions and thought to myself 'We should have made a plan first. Even a signal would've been appreciated'.

Julie let loose the arrow, which zoomed in quite rapidly towards a particularly large green slime ball. I was impressed - until it harmlessly hit the ground. Taro wasn't faring any better. He tried slashing his sword into a smaller blue slime, but the creature brushed it off and bounced back. The attack had caused a commotion and three more slimes were headed to Taro's location. Another arrow, another slash - no effect. The slimes were gathering. Carol had joined in at some point, covering Taro's flank. Divin, Arya and I were standing a distance away, behind Julie.

The other slimes were now closer and surrounding Taro and Carol. Some others were headed in our direction, probably due to Julie digging up dirt near them with her arrows. Suddenly, a blue slime jumped out of the crowd and slammed into Taro's chest. He fell flat on his butt. Carol came to him and gave him her  hand when another yellow slime smashed into her back. Thankfully, she braced herself somehow. Both of them ran back to where we were standing. Julie also stopped shooting. The crowd of slimes was now considerable and headed in our direction like an avalanche. We hightailed it out of there and almost came back to the Spawn Point itself.

···

"Well, that sucked!" Julie started, "I am down to half my arrows" she moaned.

"I tried hitting their core, but they kept slipping in and out of the crowd" Taro continued.

"Perhaps we need a plan?" Carol chimed in.

"Yes. They are attracted to arrows, which we can use to draw one in; isolate it from others and destroy its core." Divin suggested.

This back and forth continued while I realized there wasn't anything I could contribute. 'No, can't keep things like this. Need to create a spell somehow.' I excused myself, letting them know of my intentions and headed further back to the center of the Spawn Point.

While I hyped myself up, I couldn't change the fact that I had no clue what to do. A splinter of Betty followed me, the original staying with the rest. I opened up my Status Window and focused on the tilde symbol. The terminal opened up and I gave it a closer look.

Focus with an intent - this was how I concluded the interaction worked. So I focused on the window, willing it to write down the words in my head. Wait, what spell do I want? Let's go with the most generic one.

`fireball =`

'Holy Shit! Is this awesome or what? Editing with literal thoughts. These guys have achieved *perfection* itself!'

It took me a minute to wrap my head around this, but eventually, I calmed down. I looked at the float spell again. It took an argument of 'o'. 'Perhaps I could give a target to the fireball with an argument? How do I actually throw a ball of fire anyway? Wish there was a manual page I could refer to - man, do I miss the internet! Oh wait, I have a literal AI chatbot by my side. Let's see if I can scrape something out of her. It is only a matter of asking the right questions!'

"Hey Betty, do you know how I can create a fireball spell?" I asked a straight question, not expecting an answer. I wasn't disappointed. "I'm afraid I do not," she said. "So, how do I interact with the environment?" I continued. "You must use the environment variables," she replied. For a moment I thought she was having a laugh. She wasn't. 'OK good, got something' "How do I list the environment variables?" I asked. "I'm afraid I cannot answer that." 'Hmm... Would've been nice if you could' I decided to change the phrasing slightly, "How do I *use* the environment variables?" "You can modify the environment variables in your spell by focusing your intent inside the Status Window." 'Damn, no luck. Wait, how did she pass an argument to her float spell?' like a light bulb went off in my head, I was almost giddy when I asked her "Can you show me how you cast the float spell?" In retrospect, this should have been my first question, but I wasn't going to demean myself. While I was wondering about my shortcomings, she changed from her wisp form back to Cleopatra. I leveled a hard stare, not willing to miss a single twitch or whisper out of her. And then, she cast the float spell.

## Chapter 4 - Gesture Input

Betty took a few steps away from me. Raised her hands with palms towards her torso, then spoke in a clear voice - 'float'. As she rose from the ground, it seemed as if cobwebs were clearing in my mind. I gaped at her as she stabilized herself, but my thoughts were far away.

'Is this how a spell is cast then? You choose your target with your hands as an argument, then call the function - err spell, by name... She passed her own body as the argument, and now she is floating!'

I quickly opened my Status Window and got into the terminal. I erased the float spell with a thought. With another, I modified my fireball spell.

`fireball x = x.`

Well, I still didn't know how to call fire. I could choose any target into x and ignite it. 'Hmm... Environment variables she says? How about I just raise the temperature of the target to make it seem like it is on fire? Yeah, that could work' After another quick edit,

`fireball x = (x.temperature++)`

'Wait, increasing temperature by a degree would barely make the thing feverish. I need it to BURNNN. How about I double it?'

`fireball x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)`

I was itching to test it on something; so I closed my Status Window. Betty was back in her wisp form already. I looked at the ball of light - what if... No. It would be a tragically funny joke if a powerful Chat Bot went Rambo on me right now. I instead chose a patch of grass about 10 meters away. While the grass was dry, it was thankfully sparse overall. I could fireball it without needing a fire extinguisher. Taking a deep breath, I raised my hand. My palm was pointing towards a clump of a particularly dense patch. I spoke out as serenely as I could - 'fireball'. Nothing happened.

While the test was technically a failure, I did notice one important thing. When I raised my hand to "select" the clump of grass, I could somehow tell that it was too far away. Perhaps my Perception was too low? I lowered my hand, now pointing to a blade of grass a couple of meters away. No sooner had I spoken the magic word that the blade seemed to swoon. Its color had also gotten a bit darker. Test Successful! I cast fireball again on the same blade and its color went pitch black. Even in the dark evening-like ambiance, it stood out from its peers. A slight breeze disintegrated it before my eyes.

As I noticed that, another crazy idea popped into my nugget. Why stop at double? Why not square it? Heck, I could call it recursively until my target is vaporized! Man, I don't care what others say, but the Mage Class is not nerfed AT ALL. In fact, it is way too overpowered! Who cares about some attributes or special effects when you can simply smite stuff into oblivion? I immediately added a multiplier in my spell and cast it on another unfortunate blade of grass nearby. My expectations of utter destruction were betrayed however, as this time, nothing happened at all. Not even a small change in color. I reopened my Status Window and checked to see if I hadn't made any typos with my mind, but the code looked good. 'Oh wait, what is this?'

I had failed to notice it in my excitement earlier, but my Mana Point was down to 240 from the original 800. Did I just use up 560 points of mana to burn a blade of grass? As for why the last spell didn't work, I simply didn't have enough mana left. Guess Mages ain't so OP after all.

As I was resting to recover my mana - which according to Betty was quicker for Mages, I thought about the spell I just cast. Impressive as it was, it certainly wasn't what I expected. No literal fiery balls were shot around. How would one go about that, I wondered? Not that it mattered much, I now had an actual attack. Misnomer though it was. 'Hell, why not change it?' It didn't take me long to come up with a pretty original and totally not stolen name -

`incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * x.temperature)`

I was quite proud of myself, as I decided to write another function that went the other way, with a similar naming scheme.

`petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = 0)`

'Boom! Freeze mofo, all the way down to zero!!!'

While waiting for my mana to top off, I tried to remember all sorts of spells that Harry - err, that I could come up with on my own.

···

After maybe an hour or so, I headed back to where the others were. I spent the entire time testing out my abilities and limitations. In between, I had to wait for my mana to recover. Apparently, it was supposed to be slower than Stamina regen of seconds to minutes but faster than Health regen of hours to days. For a Mage, it inched quite close to Stamina. All according to Betty, of course. I couldn't get my Status Window to show actual values. In fact, I had trimmed it further. Removed all attributes - I could feel their effects anyway, and rearranged the status points. I also added a list of spells I had in my repository.

---

Yep, I decided to have only two spells for now. Not that I couldn't come up with others, but since I didn't have a way to comment out stuff, it seemed a bit hazardous to have untested lethal contraptions ready to release on a word readily available.

I also learned quite a few things about magic and spell casting. One couldn't directly change the core stats and attributes of a target. Setting HP to zero in one spell would've turned me into the fabled One Spell Man. Too bad. Also, my range was about 2 meters radius, centered around me. Depending on the factors involved, I could either fully cast a spell or not cast it at all. No half measures. I tried freezing a large region of land as an Area Effect attack. No luck. Good thing though, all spell-casts took the same amount of mana, irrespective of the target, given that they could be affected. A blade of grass, piece of a boulder and a grain of sand - all took 280 MP on Incendio, even though the effects were dramatically different on each.

As I exited the choke point and traveled across the bridge, I eventually sighted my accomplices. A few colored puddles were splashed about as if a painter had upended his paints in frustration. Up ahead, I saw one unlucky slime being whaled on by Taro, Divin, and Carol with their respective blades. Julie was standing back with the bow in one hand and a loose arrow in another, staring intently but with no apparent intention of firing. Wise choice I suppose, given her aim. Arya was standing beside Julie watching the spectacle. She noticed me as I made my way over and waved her hand awkwardly. I stood silently by their side, becoming a part of the audience. "Any luck with the spell?" she asked. "Oh, you have no idea!" I replied with a smirk.

## Chapter 5 - Slime Fest

While seemingly magical, slimes were no better than mundane beasts when it came to intellect. They were attracted by sound (or vibrations, to be precise) and attacked in a variety of ways, usually depending on their size. The golf ball-sized ones tried to trip you by spreading at your feet. Mostly though, they fled confrontation. The slightly larger ones - about the size of basketballs, bounced at you every now and then while fleeting in and out of your range. The larger ones, the size of large dogs and over, simply tried to crush everything in their path. Perhaps consume the target with the intention of suffocating them. We hadn't encountered anything larger than a pony. The most dangerous ones of the bunch were the bouncy balls, their speed and hit were no joke. At least the larger ones were sluggish and smaller ones inconsequential. Thankfully, we hadn't encountered any actual magical slimes. Like fire-wielding ones. Hell, there weren't any acidic or poisonous ones either. All they had was physical attacks. Pure XP grind.

The slimes were also immune to physical damage. Until you hit their "core," that is. Their death transformed them into puddles. No one had yet tried pure magic on them; magical skills though did seem to damage them. Divin had a Skill that did freeze damage with a slash of his sword. It was currently the group's trump card to slowing a slime down just enough to allow Taro to pierce its heart. Taro had a Skill that sharpened his strikes. Julie laid the bait, Carol ran interference. Surprisingly, Arya was the busiest of all! After our small chat, having recovered her mana, she dived back into the slaughter and spread her hands in front of Taro. A glowing light around his bruised elbow indicated she was healing him.

Just as the healing stopped, Carol pushed the slime in Divin's direction. He froze it with a large swing. Taro took the opportunity to crack the fist-sized core and add a new pinkish puddle to the palette. They all came back, probably to recover their stamina while Julie went on to collect her arrows. I decided to have a go at the next slime.

···

"Damn, how many did you get already?" (Me, admiring the polychrome ground after everyone had gathered around)

"Oh, quite a few. Got some experience points as well!" (Carol, with a slight smile)

"Not enough though. The points are spread among all four of us and one slime doesn't give out that much in the first place." (Julie, with a sigh)

"Four of you...?" (Me, confused)

"Yeah, I don't attack the slimes. I mostly heal others." (Arya, looking embarrassed for some reason)

"And yet you have the most experience points of any of us!" (Taro exclaimed)

"Well, as I said, that is simply because I am doing so much healing; all on my own too!" (Arya defended)

"Out of curiosity, how many points have you guys gained?" (Me)

"I've got 36" (Taro) "32 here" (Carol) "29 for me" (Julie) "35" (Divin, after a while)

"..." (Everyone staring at Arya again)

"Oh, fine already. Jeez. I've got 67 now, OK?" (Arya)

"And I'm zero." (Me, in a slightly lower voice, mostly to myself) "Hey, how did you figure out how to heal?" (directed at Arya)

"Oh, it's a Skill I have. Named 'Heal', haha" (Arya, chuckling) "I kinda just figured it out."

"Interesting. How much mana does it take?" (Me, slightly sullen about her intuitive knowledge)

"Oh, about 80. I can cast 3 in a row then I need to recover" (Arya)

"I see. Anyway, guys, I was wondering if I can have a go at the next slime first? Wanna try out a couple of spells." (Me, looking around)

"Sure" "OK" "Hmm" (Positive grumbles all about)

···

Betty had merged back into one. Julie was standing at the front, looking for a suitable slime to lure. I was a couple of meters behind her. Taro, Carol, and Divin were spread out behind me. Arya was at the end. Betty's light was visible beyond Arya's head, giving her a divine halo.

Soon enough, Julie released her bowstring. An arrow went and landed beside a smallish slime. Big enough to fit five tennis balls, I suppose. It rolled towards the arrow. As it was about to reach it, Julie let out another one, this one about halfway between the first and us. Another couple of arrows brought the slime within our striking distance. Julie retreated while I and the three behind me took her place.

Mana? Check. I raised my palm to the slime headed for my legs. Target selected? Check. I exhaled out stale air and filled my lungs with fresh oxygen. 'Incendio' - a slight whisper, no more. Perhaps the slime heard me? It stopped moving for a second. It then twitched and seemed to swell to twice its size. And then it popped. Even made a "pop" sound. Its core exposed to the world, still rolling on the ground towards us carried by momentum. The rest of its remains lay steaming on the ground.

I was dumbstruck. The others were no better off. They were looking at the core with mouths agape, shell shocked. I looked at my Status Window to make sure it really was my spell that did the trick. It was. All my mana was gone. Squaring the temperature rarely worked on anything bigger than a cat-sized object and it sucked all 800 points of my mana. Even on a small object, it was a hit and miss. True gamble, to be honest. Yet against the ill-fated slime, it was perfect. 'Whilst immune to physical damage, they are extra vulnerable to magical attacks, huh?' I surmised.

"Um, shouldn't we break the core?" I eventually asked. Carol moved as if in a daze and stabbed it with a dagger. My Status Window showed I had earned 11 experience points. Everyone seemed to wake up from their dreams, with varied expressions on their face.

"Man, what was that? Incendio? OP Skill man, how much mana does it take?," Taro was excited beyond words. "It takes all the considerable mana I have. It's not a Skill though, more of a spell" I replied, arguing semantics for no reason. "Still, it was awesome!" 'I agree, it was.' "Now we don't have to stab one a billion times to kill it. That is some nice spell" Julie interjected. 'I agree, it is'. "Did you all get experience points from that one as well?" I asked. "Nah, only I got 'em," Carol said, "and only 3 though. Since you did the most damage. You gotta contribute to the fight somehow to get some, even if you don't directly hit anything. You get points according to your contribution." she concluded. "So, you guys still have to fight then," I wondered aloud. "Yes," Divin said, "but it is different now. First, we all will take shots at it. Then you explode it. Then one of us finishes it off. Much more efficient." I was of the same mind. That being said, I can't be out of the fight after a single spell - one that may or may not even work. I decided to revert to my temperature double for the time being. If I paced myself properly, I could fight continuously for however long my mana and stamina held. 'Perhaps one spell every couple minutes. Yeah, that would work.'

···

With that, we all went on a rampage. While Incendio still popped the smaller ones, it turned the mid-sized ones into a more liquidy state from their semi-solid sludge one. The larger ones seemed to shrug it off though. But I had another spell. I had tweaked this one as well; reducing temperature to zero worked even more infrequently than squaring it. I simply halved it instead. It did not literally freeze them but slowed them all considerably. We were never swamped. Julie lured in a bunch of slimes at once, we fought on multiple fronts and gained experience at an accelerated pace.

No one knew how much time went by. The sky was still dusky. We weren't hungry or thirsty, let alone sleepy. Whenever we felt a bit tired, we took time out and capped off our stamina points. Then back into the fight. Julie could now hit a slime once every 5 tries on average. Divin and Taro's slashes were getting slightly more precise as if they had gotten hang of the swords' weight. Carol was getting slightly better at evading jumpy slimes while kiting them. Arya had managed to find a good pace of healing, that required the least amount of rest in between. The bouncy balls did the most damage, but it was limited to small bruises. Must have been several hours at least. Some of the earlier puddles had vanished. We only noticed it because there were patches of brown grass where supposed colorful ponds were meant to be. I hadn't experimented with any more spells so far. While the fight was not exhausting physically, it was draining in an entirely different way. If we had a 'mental capacity' point, we would all be very low on it. It was in this situation that Arya suddenly exclaimed - "Guys? I just leveled up"

## Chapter 6 - Level Up

We had gathered around Arya, as she stood scrutinizing her updated Status Window. When she was done, we all looked at her expectantly.

"Well, there isn't much actually. Nothing new." she grumbled, "I just got an extra point on all my attributes. My stats have increased a bit as well. That's all."

"No new Skills?" Taro asked. "None" she replied.

"What about a Class upgrade? Did you get that?" I questioned. She replied in a negative. 'On second thoughts, what is a Class upgrade anyway?' Apparently, Divin thought the same, as he questioned Betty about it.

Betty's wispy form shone brightly for a split second, then she said, "Where a Level Upgrade is a quantitative change in your Class, a Class Upgrade is a qualitative one. There are 5 upgrades that you can get every 5 Level Ups starting with Novice at Level 0, Competent on Level 5, Proficient on Level 10, Expert on Level 15, finally Master on Level 20."

"So... All we get are extra points on Level Ups? And what do you mean *qualitative change*?" Julie asked.

"Yes, Level Ups affect only your attribute points. Generally, you get plus one on every attribute; however, depending on your Special Effects, it may be incremented or decremented further. While it does *look* like a numerical change, it has many subtle effects that I recommend you explore on your own. As for the Class Upgrades, they are heavily dependent on what Class and Special Effects you have in place and produce a distinct change in your Status. It would take quite a while to list all possibilities. I am sure you will understand when you undergo the same." Betty concluded.

Arya suddenly exclaimed, "She's right. Even if it's just a plus one in numbers, it changes a lot of things. I just tried casting a Heal and not only can I cast it from further away, but it also takes less mana! Now that I have more mana as well, I can go on with shorter breaks!"

···

Our short interlude soon came to a head and we got back into the fight. Many of us were close to leveling up now. Half the field was clear of slimes as well! I popped a murky slime trying to trip Carol, froze another trying to latch onto Taro, and took a step back to get a broader view of the fight. Divin and Julie were doing fine on the left. Arya kept her distance, so she was safe for now. The freeze spell was handy; it cost a bit less mana at 240 and was quite effective at slowing the bouncy balls down for a while. The frozen slime eventually shivered a bit and got back to bouncing on Taro. I froze it again so Taro could get a clear shot at the core, and that's when it happened. I don't know *how* it happened. But I knew - I had leveled up. It certainly was a surprise to me, given I was behind everyone in XP at the start.

"Guys, I leveled up as well! I'm gonna go take a look at my stats," I said and retreated, after ensuring they didn't need my support. Not much I could do on low mana anyway. The others continued on their fight; I noticed Julie didn't draw any more slimes towards us.

I ran back way behind even Arya and opened my Status Window. I had hidden my attributes previously, so I made them visible again and saw what had changed.

---

| Attributes   | Points |
| --------     | ------ |
| Strength     | 2      |
| Vitality     | 2      |
| Agility      | 2      |
| Dexterity    | 3      |
| Intelligence | 10     |
| Perception   | 3      |
| Wisdom       | 3      |

---

'I see, plus one on each. Nothing more, nothing less. Not surprising, I suppose.' I thought. I hid them again and went back to my Status Window.

'Ugh, I understand my low SP. Never was high on endurance training. But only 120 HP!?! I'm pretty sure everyone else has way more than me. Also, XP is down to 0 again, eh? Makes sense.'

I made my way back to the scene of the fight. Divin and Julie were about to finish off a bluish head-sized slime while Carol and Taro were nipping at another. Arya was healing a wound on Carol's shoulder, at least whenever she paused from hopping about. I stood there, pensively watching the fight waiting for my stats to recover.

···

I got back in the fight again, after we all had another break to recover. I noticed that my spells were taking about 10 less mana. With the increased mana pool, I could now cast 3 successive Incendios and still have some mana left. Neat!

Another few hours went by in a flash. Fight, recover, repeat. The rest of the merry band had leveled up as well. Despite that, we didn't change our strategy. It was working, and it was working *well*.

While the cheer brought by our level-ups kept our stress at bay for a bit, it could only hold for so long. I was wondering how far we would make it when Julie sighted the exit. 'Good eyes on you, Miss Archer. Wait, does she have a Skill that lets her see far away or something?' I pondered as I tried to make out the exit myself.

I saw it. Another damn bridge. Well, at least this one was wider than the makeshift ledge the last one was. I was puzzled as to why it was called a Dungeon when there were no stairs going up and down anywhere.

We eventually made our way there. Not only were all of us level 1, but some of us were also halfway to level 2 - myself included. The field was mostly clear of slimes, a few still meandering at the edges. While the ground seemed psychedelic with color nearer to us, further on, it was returning to its natural color. It was a brown blur back where we had started from. We gazed at the ground where we had spent however many hours fighting magical ooze of fantasy, then turned our back on the field that granted us our first level up.

## Chapter 7 - Settling down

"'Twas my little brother's 14th birthday the day after tomorrow. I was gonna bake him a cake." Carol mumbled.

We were all resting on the bridge, sitting down, and coming to terms with our current predicament. When we first appeared here, we were confused. Soon we got busy hunting slimes. Now that we had a moment to reflect, the reality hit us like a freight train.

"What sort of cake?" I asked just to keep the conversation flowing.

"A cheesecake, perhaps. My mum was set on strawberries though," she chuckled. I sniggered as well, more out of formality than amusement.

The conversation would have died then, if not for Julie. "My boyfriend and I were going to visit my folks. I was going to introduce him. I was quite nervous; we were going steady and I really wanted them to all like each other. Guess that's one thing I don't have to worry about anymore." She chuckled as well. I decided not to add my formal snigger this time.

"Well, you'll have to worry about it as soon as we go back," I tried to cheer her up. Julie looked at me confused. Even the others did the same.

"You do know where we are, right? We've been here for what, a few days already? I don't know how fucking long this test run is going to last but what I do know is that Jake isn't gonna wait decades for me to come back." she growled, with barely concealed anger and sadness.

"Didn't you hear what Betty said? Time flows differently here and back home." I asked. Then I remembered that I was the one who had asked the question and received an answer. Others probably didn't catch on it. "Isn't that right Betty? What exactly is the time difference between the simulation and the real world?" I turned to the ball of light in our midst.

"Every month in the Simulation is a second in your world. And every month in the Tutorial is a second in the Simulation, a month being a standard 30 day period." she intoned.

"See? Our time in the Tutorial scarcely counts back home. Once we complete the Tutorial and find an exit back home, barely a second or two would have passed," I concluded. I also wondered how many humans these guys must have kidnapped and tested on out here. Time dilation was quite convenient.

The conversation tapered off after that. This time though, the people did less wallowing in self-pity and more figuring out how this new information affected their situation. The way I saw it, it didn't really matter how long we spent inside the Simulation. Even if we spent 100 years inside, back home barely 20 minutes would've passed. Not that it mattered to me. I hated being pushed around by others. Become a guinea pig for some weird test? Fuck that! I was gonna bug out ASAP.

···

I wasn't particularly thirsty. But for some reason, I craved water. Never in my life had I been through such an onerous exercise and did not need a drop of water. It felt weird. I also wanted some food. Not that I was hungry. I wondered how long it had been since I last ate. In fact, I asked Betty, "Hey Betty, how long have we been in this Tutorial?" She replied "16 hours and 43 minutes." 'Not even a day has passed? I feel like I've been here for eons. Damn!'

The others were shocked as well. Taro had a particularly funny look on his face. 'Time dilation affects us mentally too, eh?' I joked to myself.

We had been here for a while. Our clothes were clean as if new. The slime remains worked surprisingly like dry cleaning. The sky was still dark of dusk. Some stars really would've been nice, it gets damn depressing looking up to nothing. I wished we had a fire going. Not that I was cold. The temperature was just right. Since none of us was a Craftsman nor had we any clue otherwise of how to start a fire, we just laid about like drunken sailors, sitting with our backs against the railings in the middle of the bridge.

The entrance of the next "level" was visible ahead, although I couldn't peer past it to see the terrain. While we were resting, I opened my Status Window and decided to write some more spells. I still remembered Betty's float spell, so I decided to emulate it.

---

```
incendio o = (o.temperature = o.temperature * 2)

petrificus_totalus o = (o.temperature = o.temperature / 2)

float o = ((o.elevation + 1) * 2)
```

---

While I had no control over gravity yet, doubling the elevation should be enough. Added one in case the elevation was zero. 'Anyway, let us test,' I thought and pointed my palm at a nearby pebble. "Float," I said, as quietly as possible so I didn't disturb others from their ruminations, and the pebble moved. In place. It barely left the ground. 'So gravity is still pulling it down eh?', I thought, 'No leviosa for me today!' With a thought, the float spell was removed. I wasn't that bummed about the failure, I even sort of expected it. I asked Betty if she had any other spells. Affirmative. I asked if could she upload them to my repository. Negative. Apparently, it was a one-time thing. I asked if she could *cast* any of her spells. Negative on that one as well. She wasn't able to cast spells outside of Spawn Point. I briefly considered going back but then decided against it. It's not like she said she would cast them there just for me, what if that was a one-time thing as well?

I decided I'd rather catch a shut-eye, even if I didn't need it. I closed my eyes against the gloomy dark and made myself as comfortable as possible on the hard stone. I couldn't sleep right away, I never did anyway even back home. Everyone had quieted down. Silence reigned for a while. Soon I heard heavy breathing coming from Divin's side. I even perceived someone sniffling softly. I decided to feign sleep until I actually did.

···

Julie was the first to move. "We should get going," she said. Probably more for her own sake than others. We all got up. There was no way out but through.

While it was true that we didn't *need* sleep when speaking in terms of stats and points, but as humans, it certainly helped a lot. Of course, we didn't wake up filled with happiness or anything of the sort. Things just seemed... More manageable, somehow. No one commented on Carol's puffy eyes. I personally felt slightly chipper now than I did before.

As we reached the entrance, Betty's light casting long shadows ahead of us, a sight of ruin welcomed us. It was literally, a ruin. Alabaster statues with missing heads decorated the buildings made of tilted pillars and broken walls. I couldn't see how far this ruin extended, the decaying structures blocked my view further.

Suddenly, I noticed movement in the corner of my eye. I focused on it and saw a solitary vine swinging down. "Monkey?" Taro questioned no one in particular. "Yeah, it looked like a baboon," Julie answered. I must've missed it. 'Monkey ain't that bad, right?' I thought.

That was when Betty decided to make an announcement: "This is Level 1 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Imp Ruins!"

## Chapter 8 - Impish Impulse

Slimes were one thing, they felt more or less like jelly in motion. Stabbing monkeys to death was a different matter, however. No one took the initiative to step forward. I noticed several more of our supposed prey gathering ahead of us on a precariously upright wall. Taking a closer look, I noticed some differences in their physiology that made it harder for me to call them just monkeys. Especially the small leathery wings on their back. While our party stood at an impasse, more of these "imps" had gathered around.

There must've been around eight of these critters staring down at us when a slightly larger one of them dropped down to the ground. It took a couple steps towards us. We were perhaps 15 meters away from it. The attention of all the members, both human and imp, was focused on this particular pioneer. I was wondering what it was trying to do. 'Perhaps sniff for snacks?' I was immediately proved wrong when it picked up a small rock. Before any of us could register what was happening, it swung its hand and the rock came sailing at Taro's face. Thankfully, the rock whizzed past his head and plopped harmlessly onto the ground behind. I looked at Taro, then I looked at the imp. It was still standing there as if waiting for our reaction. It certainly got one.

Julie notched her arrow and fired at the culprit. Of course, it was never going to hit, but the imp didn't know that. Neither did its friends on the wall. They skedaddled out of the clearing faster than you could say imp. In that regard, they did comically seem like monkeys.

···

As time went by, the varmints grew bolder. There were over 20 of them now, taking turns throwing rocks at us while the rest egged them on. Julie stopped shooting at them after her seventh arrow. According to her, it was a waste of arrows against such numbers. I think it had more to do with how they cackled when her last arrow had hit a pillar far away from any of them. All seven of her arrows now had new owners, being held like short spears and used to poke the poor plebeians who didn't have one.

We were stuck. Sometimes Taro and Carol threw rocks back. At first, the imps were guarded. Then they guffawed at the rocks as well. While they didn't exactly mount an attack on us, we couldn't go ahead anyway. Not unless we wished to get stoned to death halfway through. Perhaps a Craftsman would've been useful here, making traps and lures.

'Traps, eh?' a sudden idea hit me. I gathered the group around and explained the process. I could see the poorly hidden doubt in their dubious faces. Still, no one else had any better solution, so we decided to give it a go. We had already lost seven arrows, what does one more matter?

···

It was again the pioneer imp that took the initiative. So far, the distance between us and the imps had been constant. But now it couldn't maintain the same anymore. All of its friends had arrows of their own, whereas the who took the first step was still empty-handed. It didn't sit well with the imp. Now its greed overwhelmed its caution. We must've seemed harmless enough anyway, what with our misguided arrows and unenthusiastic rock throws.

It ambled towards the arrow stuck deep into the earth. Perhaps only a centimeter of it was visible above. The imp knew it was a shiny arrow though, for it had seen us bury it not so long ago. All of us had even retreated from the spot, now standing further back almost behind the entrance, watching the show. Well... Not all of us. Carol stood all by her lonesome behind a decrepit pillar by the side. Perhaps she was trying to hide? Either way, the imp didn't give Carol more than a glance. It was confident in its ability to run away at the slightest of sounds. And the larger group was in its sight anyway. Nothing stood between it and the arrow.

Soon it reached the spot and gave a tug at the stem. It looked us over to make sure we hadn't made a move. We hadn't. It then tugged harder. Not enough. It tried to use both hands. No grip. Soon, it was apparent that pulling the thing out wasn't gonna work, so it quickly set to digging. After giving us a cautionary glace of course. Unfortunately for the imp, it hadn't noticed Carol moving out from behind the pillar. She was using her Skill of silent footsteps. I had also cast Incendio on her dagger - twice. After freezing the lump of ground holding the arrow, that is.

I was actually impressed by how firm Carol stayed, given that she was about to stab the primate in the back. She reached from behind the imp, which was still engrossed in clawing out cold soil. It also ignored the pandemonium its brethren were making, perhaps mistaking it for encouragement. So lost was it in the task, that it didn't notice the dagger until it was out poking through its chest. The girl certainly didn't take half measures. The blade had cut clean through.

I had a cognition that my XP stash had increased. I would've checked the Status Window to confirm, but the scene that was unfolding held my full attention. The imp fingered the point of the dagger, then touched the end of the arrow longingly. Not a moment later, it slumped down with a confused mewl. Interestingly enough, there was not a drop of blood. The imps fur changed as if it had caught fire, originating from the wound. The fire then went on to consume the whole body, leaving but a pinch of dark ash behind, which soon scattered in the non-existent wind.

···

Nobody moved for several seconds. The imps had ceased their uproar as if on cue. Carol stood looking down at her dagger. If there had been wind here, one could've heard a whoosh sound. And then everyone moved at once. A few imps screeched loudly and made for Carol, who was about to pick her dagger up. The rest ran back to wherever they came from. We made a dash for Carol as well, shouting warnings at her. Unlike the dead imp though, she didn't ignore her companions. Didn't even look back. She ran towards us as soon as the dagger was in her hand.

Must've been about 6 imps. Perhaps they were close friends and family of the pioneer. The madness and rage in their eyes was certainly a sight to behold. Just as Carol joined us, she turned back again and we clashed with the incoming gamins. I had recovered just enough mana to freeze three of them. Taro, Divin, and Carol engaged the other three. While we certainly weren't experts at combat, we had recent experience being swarmed. Our previous foes were even immune to physical damage. And these imps weren't thinking straight. All they had was their ferocity and slightly sharp claws. Everything else was working against them. Numbers, equipment, range, power, we outmatched them in all. It wasn't long before one went down, then another, and another. I hadn't even recovered mana to cast another spell when the last one was ablaze.

I noticed that the damage, shallow though it was, was quite extensive. We had scratches all over our limbs, Carol even had some on her face. To say it was uncomfortable was an understatement. 'I hope we don't catch some weird disease,' I pondered. Arya took her sweet time healing us all. Several times, she had to cast heal multiple times on a single wound. That being said, it was quite magical in the way it healed. Not a single blemish remained as if the wounded had never existed. 'It *is* magic though,' I contemplated as I mulled over the Status Window and XP gains from the fight.

## Chapter 9 - The Unknown

We moved on with our expedition. Our M.O. was to seek open spaces in between the ruins so that the imps couldn't ambush us. When there were enough gathered, we would lay our arrow trap and lure one in. They fell for it every single time. Perhaps they were blessed with primate instincts, yet I couldn't help but wonder at their absolute lack of learning. Or perhaps the arrows were simply too tempting. Either way, Carol would assassinate the courageous one, while the rest quickly took care of the following enraged family. I had stopped casting spells on the ground and dagger, it didn't help much.

About halfway through the ruin - well I assumed it was halfway because we were walking on for what seemed like a day, the whole process of luring, assassinating and eventual chaos of blades and claws got so repetitive that Julie and I were having a casual conversation while the rest were in the midst of another broil.

"...so how did you and Jake meet?" I asked.

"It's not that interesting or romantic as you might expect. We were both interns at the same firm. One day he just asked me out of nowhere; I said yes, and so it began!" Julie replied with a nostalgic smile.

"It's hard to find someone so compatible. But Jake and Julie, even your names have a nice rhythm of sorts. J and J!" I made a stupid observation, eyeing the glow on Divin's wrist that was being healed by Arya just outside the fight.

"Well, my name isn't actually Julie. In German, it comes out something close to Hulia, but I doubt you guys could pronounce it," she said while putting the arrow in her hand back inside the quiver. The fight was coming to an end.

"I'll stick to Julie, no problem. By the way, my name isn't Pat either!" I said with a mysterious smile. Julie looked at me with a smile of her own and asked, "Oh, what is it then?" "Ah, you probably won't be able to pronounce it either." I smirked, opting to extend the mystery. The rest of the gang had returned by then.

···

"It has been 3 days, 2 hours and 13 minutes since we began from Spawn Point." Betty replied to a question from Julie.

'So we've been wandering these ruins for a better part of 2 days? Wow.' This time, it certainly did feel like it. The imps came at us sporadically, unlike the constant churn of slimes. I was mostly relegated to the rear position now since my contribution to the fight was limited to cold spell at the start. The imps usually died out before I could recover my mana. Interestingly enough, Incendio did not seem to affect them as much as Petrificus did. I couldn't figure out why exactly.

The mêlée combatants of our group were raking in XP. I bet Carol must have gained several times than the rest with her solo kills. Oh, the rest didn't include Arya, she was an outlier. I was proved correct soon when she leveled up again. I checked my Status Window, I still needed about 55 XP. At least I was ahead of Julie. Not that it mattered, I doubt we'd leave anyone behind. 'Would we not, if it really came to it?' I wondered.

It must've been our twelfth ambush when I noticed something that hadn't happened before. A particularly large imp, largest so far, had decided to have a go at the arrow. When Carol jammed her dagger into its throat, it was momentarily aflame like normal, but it didn't leave behind just ashes. When the flames died out, we saw an old boot lying on the ground. 'Is that a monster drop?' I was amazed. This was so game-like. I did not, however, put the old boot into my inventory. First, I didn't need it. Second, I had no inventory. The others ignored it as well, after the initial curious glance or two. The incoming horde of imps also demanded our attention.

···

"My major is Environmental Science. I wanna be part of this community, ya know? Have people come together, help each other out. That is the end goal anyway. Planting some trees is a part of the journey; making our planet greener is not such a bad idea after all." Carol answered to my question about her studies and activities.

"So, which university in Ireland do you go to?" I continued. "Ah, ya know. I am *from* Ireland, but my college is in the England. I've been staying there since last year" she said. "Cool... What about you Arya, what do you do?" I turned to Arya. Julie, Taro, and Divin where on a lookout of sorts. They were also verifying our heading, making sure we weren't going around in circles. Since it was troublesome for only one to go, we had split up in 2 groups. Arya, Carol, and I were holding the fort with one half of Betty. Also, Arya was healing our minor wounds from a recent scuffle. "I'm a fashion designer," she said. Arya wasn't as tight-lipped as she was before. Now that I looked at her closely, she was quite pretty as well. "Artistic eh? Nice." I said. While I noticed a small scratch on the back of my hand mend, Carol asked Arya about her hometown. "Oh, I'm from Canada. Well, technically, I was born in India, but my family moved to Canada when I was 6. Been there for almost 20 years now."

'Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia' I guess we're missing members only from Australia. I doubt Antarctica would be considered anyway. Uniform distribution, for sure. "So you're a programmer then?" Arya brought me out of my contemplation. "Ah yes, I work as a Software Developer," I said. "Then, can I ask you for a favor?" Arya said in a slightly flustered tone. "Oh, of course. What is it?" I asked. I could already imagine what it could be. "I want to learn how to create customized spells. I guess you've already created a couple. How hard is it?" she asked, growing quite interested. "Well, it's not hard in the sense of creating one. It's more a matter of information shortage that holds you back here," I said. I wondered if I could've worded it better. I tried again, looking at her confused expression. "I mean, it is easy to write a spell, as long as you have the information you need to write one. It's like... Well, writing a recipe. Writing the recipe itself is not the problem. The issue is we don't know what ingredients we have." I explained. "So how do we find the ingredients?" came the obvious question. "Now that... That is a very good question."

···

We ran some experiments. While Carol had the tilde symbol in her Status Window as well, it was greyed out and barely visible. She couldn't open the terminal. Arya, on the other hand, could. I had her type in Incendio with her mind. That was it though. She couldn't cast the spell. We enquired Betty about the same. Apparently, Healer Class did not have access to the temperature of a target. Ironic, really. All their spells had to target HP, MP or SP in one way or another, without directly modifying them. The fact that changing temperature could affect HP was immaterial, a minor side effect. I couldn't figure out this weird restriction, wondering how her 'Heal' Skill worked. I felt like I was missing something. Upon further experimentation, it was revealed that we also didn't have access to the source code of the Skill. Basically, we were stuck.

While Arya was trying out random things in her terminal, the other group and Betty's other half came back. I could sense the excitement from their faces. Even the ever stoic Divin had a slight curve to his lips. My curiosity was eventually sated when Taro exclaimed - "We found the exit!"

## Chapter 10 - Id

A few more tussles and all of us reached level 2, Julie and myself being the last. No significant changes to my stats, except my mana reached 920. Quite a random increase. First I got 80 mana off single Intelligence point, and now only 40? There wasn't even any change in mana consumption. Still took 230 & 270 mana points for Petrificus and Incendio respectively. I couldn't comprehend the scale. Betty's explanation wasn't any more helpful.

Since we were already at the exit, we decided to march ahead. We were again blessed with a bridge over an abyss. Looking over the railing, Taro asked, "How deep do you think it goes?" "Perhaps it never ends!" I added my two cents.

"It has to end somewhere, right?" he countered. "Well, not necessarily. Maybe it loops back out top from the bottom?" I argued. "It can do that?" he exclaimed, wide-eyed. "Sure, I like to think that is how our real Universe is. When you reach the end, you just portal back. No real end or beginning." Speaking of the "real" world, in however obtuse words, brought a wave of sombreness over us. No one spoke after that, as we crossed the bridge over to level 2.

···

As we graced the entrance of Level 2 we were treated to a landscape filled with hills and caves. I was filled with dread, remembering the movies based on this exact terrain. Hopefully, the denizens of the movie were not haunting these lands. Again, I couldn't see the end. Perhaps this time, it was actually far off. Nor could I see any movement. Not that that was good news.

This time, Carol took the initiative. She decided to silent her footsteps and tentatively went ahead scanning around in all directions. While I wasn't going to suggest the girl go ahead and check for monsters, as a Scout, I guess that was her prerogative. Wise, even. No one spoke out loud but gave their silent consent. She advanced about 10 meters ahead of us. 'Baby steps now, can't have her go out all alone, Scout or not.'

Suddenly Betty announced, "This is Level 2 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Kin of Sobek." The kin of what now? And why did she announce it now? We hadn't even seen anything. Wait. 'Maybe she doesn't announce it when we see something. Maybe she does it when *somethings sees us*!' We stopped walking. Carol was shaking like a leaf, having come to a similar conclusion, I deduced. Or perhaps she knew what a Sobek was? I wanted to ask Betty what it meant, but I was too busy scanning for the thing, praying it won't come out of the ground or something. Just as I was about to suggest moving on, Julie screamed and took off back to the entrance. Everyone panicked and made a mad dash behind her. Soon enough we were back, poor Carol sweating from head to toe. "What the hell?" she screamed between quick pants.

···

"A large crocodile!?!" We were all aghast. "Yes, it was looking at us from the shadows in the cave off to the left. I'm sorry, I was just so scared. It looked right at me!" Julie described, now considerably calmer.

"How many did you see?" Divin asked. It certainly wasn't a good idea to be swarmed by large crocodile monsters. "Ah, I saw only one and then I ran. I don't know if there were more" Julie replied.

No one suggested going back to check. We just stood there, perhaps gathering courage. I certainly was in no hurry to become a crocodile hunter. I'd seen on TV how powerful their jaw strength was, bursting watermelons like balloons.

So we decided to take a short break there. We could make a routine of taking short naps on bridges hanging over nothingness. I wasn't in any mood to sleep, my time in Level 1 was more or less relaxed. So I opened up my Status Window and decided to go through another trial and error session.

···

'So, everything in this Simulation is an object and I can directly mutate their values. Of course, there are permissions and privileges, dos and donts, but the fact still remains. I wonder if I can print the objects somehow? That would be an awesome push to my progress!'

Since the function definition looked like Haskell, I decided to try out one of its inbuilt function.

```hs
print_object o = (id o)
```

'OK, let's try this'. I lifted my hand and pointed to a pebble. "Print object," I whispered. Nothing.

'Perhaps it takes in cout or console.log?' I tried out several variations. 'Nope. Hmm, what if...?' I modified the program.

```sh
print_object o = (echo o)
```

This time, I lost 45 mana. And a new window overlapped my terminal.

---

### Rubble

---

'Hallelujah, this damn thing takes shell commands. Woo!!!' I was excited beyond measure. I again suppressed my urge to do a victory dance. Arya, however, noticed. "You're doing your weird smile again." She didn't stay quiet this time, opting to mutter her thoughts to me. "Ah, yes. I managed to create a new spell!" I confided. The others were resting, fitfully or otherwise. Arya came over and inquired about the new spell. I deliberated over how to best explain it to her; teaching object-oriented stuff would be a pain in the behind. I decided to change the name to help the case.

```sh
identify o = (echo o)
```

"You can get information about a thing using this spell, Identify." I said as I helped her type the code in her terminal. I didn't expect it to run, but to my surprise, it actually did! Why did identify run, when it has nothing to do with any stats? I immediately called Betty over, hissed my befuddlement, and leveled her with a cold stare. Betty replied guilelessly, "Healer Class cannot directly affect HP, neither can Mage for that matter. Also, Healers do not have access to parameters that are not co-dependent on HP. The identify spell, as you can see, is not interacting with any of the object's parameters. So the restrictions do not apply." A lot to unpack there but it somehow made sense in a convoluted way. So Arya couldn't change temperature because it wasn't really dependent on HP directly. Even her 'Heal' Skill worked directly on wounds. I see... 'I'll think about it some other time though. Gotta experiment with identify!' and so, Arya and I went around identifying random things. Of course, after the pebble, I ran it on her first!

'Ah, just this? I should've been able to see things like temperature as well since I can modify it. Perhaps my level is too low? Hey, at least I can see the level, Class and effects. That's a good start.' Arya had her palm pointed at me as well, her eyes glassy. Soon she came back, our eyes met and she smiled at me. "This is a damn good spell!" she said. "I agree, it is!" I replied, slightly puffing my chest. Identify used up 70 of her mana, where it took only 45 for me. Another interesting discovery. Eventually, I ran out of things to identify around me. Julie did have an eyesight related special effect. Intriguingly, identify didn't work on Betty. It consumed mana, yes, but showed a blank screen.

While I wasn't really sleepy, the run back has sapped my SP. The exhaustion was catching up. So I decided to take a short nap. And that was just what I did.

## Chapter 11 - Crocodile Hunters 1

Taro, Divin, and I were moving forward with the ladies trailing behind us at a distance. This was our new formation, where the three guys had become meat shields for some reason.

The hullabaloo of previous Levels was absent, instead filled with deceptive tranquility. Despite our strain, or perhaps because of it, we were having a light conversation. Taro had initiated it, asking me about my home town. Currently, we were on the topic of his school.

"... Oh you know, it's not like they teach anything meaningful. Plus, I had my exams coming up next week. I was summoned at a perfect time. Now I don't have to study anymore!" he grinned.

"Haha," I laughed softly, choosing not to mention the time difference again. "What about you Divin? What sort of business do you own?" I switched the conversation to Divin.

"Hmm, you know. Odds and ends..." He waved it off. "I see," I said. I didn't. Thinking about it now, on the spectrum of most talkative on the right to least on left, Divin would sit on the extreme left. Carol would probably be on the other end, followed closely by Taro. I guess Julie, myself and Arya were somewhere in between, in that order.

Pretty soon, we reached the place where we had run back from before. Looking off to the left, I scanned the caves for signs of a crocodile. I didn't have to search for long. I soon saw it, just at the mouth of the cave sitting still with its mouth wide open, half-concealed by the long shadows of evening. Forget a balloon, it could pop my head like a bubble; that is how large it was. We stood and stared at it watchfully. It didn't move a muscle.

As we stood, the girls made their way to our position. Then they gawked the reptile as well. It still didn't move. Eventually, Taro looked around the group and nodded. 'No man, don't!' I almost shouted, but I knew we had no choice. I decided to move as well, given I had the highest damage rate with my spells. I had to hit it first like I usually did at the start of every fight against monsters. Divin wavered for a bit, then joined us as well. We were back in our new formation, except this time, the girls decided to stay put. We moved on to get a closer look at our next supposed prey.

···

A very large crocodile, perhaps 6 meters in length, laid still on the ground. During our advance, it had slowly closed its large snout. If we hadn't seen it open beforehand, perhaps we would've been fooled into thinking that it hadn't moved at all!

We were about 20 meters away from it. It didn't move. We moved ahead haltingly, reaching almost 10 meters near it. 'Damn, this thing is BIG!' I thought to myself. I guessed it came close in size to some of the largest crocodiles on our planet. We stopped there, hesitant to move forward. I could now actually see the monster appraise us. There was a glint of beastly intellect in its eyes that you see only in apex predators.

I lifted my hand, hoping to get a selection. Nope. I inched closer, praying it wouldn't suddenly jump out and grab at me. I couldn't select it still, but this time, the monster moved. Ever so slowly, it lifted its front leg and moved it forward. With a characteristic flex of its body, it moved the other leg ahead. I couldn't see the hind legs, shrouded in shadow as they were. It moved excruciatingly slow. I was tense as a drawn bowstring, ready to scamper off at the slightest hint of trouble.

As we watched it amble towards us languidly, we realized that the thing moved as if in slow motion. Perhaps it was bogged down by its own weight. I still kept my hand lifted though, and perhaps it was about 6 meters away from us when I could suddenly feel something different. I was able to select it! 'Wow, my level up must've affected my range more than I thought.' I quickly cast Identify on it.

---

### Kin of Sobek - Level ?

*Special Effect*

* Transient Life: You are a temporary variable in a short-lived calculation.

---

Before I could process what was written on the screen, my caution overwhelmed my curiosity. The crocodile was no more than 5 meters ahead of me and I wasn't about to let it get any closer. With my palm already pointing at its snout, I shouted out the name of my most damaging spell - "INCENDIO!"

···

If you have ever felt stupid in life, think of what I had just done. I had cast a heat spell on a cold-blooded reptile monster when it was but a few meters away from me and heading in my direction for a light snack. The effect was immediate. It first spent a couple of seconds as if enjoying the heat spread through its thick body and then it raced towards us instantly.

I had never in my life ran faster than when I did after being chased by the crocodile monster. I gave no thought to Taro, nor to Divin. In my Usain B. moment, I hazily noticed that the girls were already gone. I reached the entrance within what felt like hours and seconds at the same time. The other guys were at my heels, apparently. The girls stood just beyond, panting on the bridge. Looking back, the crocodile had given up chase after barely a few meters, now languishing back in its nest; perhaps deciding to conserve its heat.

I felt ludicrous about my actions. I was also utterly drained from my sprint. I felt like the stupidest bum if there ever was one. But for some reason, I started laughing. Yes, I felt incredibly dumb. Yes, my life was in danger, if only for a couple of seconds. Yet I couldn't help it at all. I sniggered loudly, then burst into full-blown laughter. Soon, I was joined by Carol, Taro, and Arya as well. While I did not see them in my mirth, I bet Julie and Divin had grins on their faces as well.

"Well, that was stupid," I said after our giggle-fit died down. "Yeah, but at least now we have a fighting chance," Divin said. "I agree," I said thinking about how Petrificus would affect these things. "So what exactly happened?" Julie asked, with Arya and Carol perking their ears. Taro took the responsibility to regale them with our hilarious and deadly adventure. Slightly exaggerating it in the process, of course.

···

'Transient Life, eh?' I thought about the special effect on the creature. 'I guess these things are explicitly created for the purpose of this tutorial. I wonder what will happen to the place after we leave?' I asked Betty the same. "Yes, the level and monsters in it are garbage collected after you pass on to the next level," she replied, "Level 0 and 1, along with creatures inhabiting them, now no longer exist."

For some reason, I felt sad about it. But then again, that is how these things work. 'Temporary variables for sure,' I thought as I brooded over the matter for a while.

## Chapter 12 - Crocodile Hunters 2

This was the second time I was dumbstruck by the sheer utility of a spell. First, when it popped the slime into a steaming nothing. Now, when it stunned a giant reptile into near immobility.

Sure, the area of effect was less. I had cast Petrificus on its belly from the side while Carol distracted it from the other side. And yet, the effect was quite dramatic. Slowly but surely, it closed its eyes and shrank its legs unto itself. Like saying goodnight to the world. Desperate efforts were made on the crocodile's part to get back into the safety of its shelter, but the three blade-masters had become quite ruthless by now. Not to mention the continuous onslaught of Julie's arrows. She missed less and less the closer she dared to come to the creature.

After 3 rapid doses of my freeze spell, the thing went rigid. Its skin was thick but that only lengthened the agony. Before long, we had taken down our first crocodile monster. This was also our first fight where Arya's help was unnecessary. I doubt we would've needed her help if we had lost against that one - we would've been crushed beyond repair.

Interestingly, the crocodile did not bleed either. At least not blood. While its wounds were dark nothings, its body turned into a watery splotch when it died. I asked Betty if all the monsters are the same. According to her, the monsters in the tutorial were specially created to be cannon fodder for the test subjects. The reason they did not bleed was so the subjects could get acclimated to killing them. Very kind of our kidnappers to worry about our mental state. The monster counterparts in the 'outer world' were quite varied. And bled when struck. If a level 2 guy like me had encountered a crocodile, like this one in its natural habitat, that would be it for me.

I opened my Status Window to check my gains from the kill.

'Whoa, I got 32 XP for this piece of cake? 9 more crocs and I'm level 3 baby! Ah, I bet mine was the highest though, so others probably got less.'

Apparently, while I was correct, the difference in XP wasn't as big as I had imagined. Everyone received somewhere between 20 to 30 XP.

'Except Arya. I wonder how she will get to level 3 here without having to heal?'

I was looking at her as I thought that when she cast a heal upon herself. She must've noticed my questioning gaze, because she replied, "Ah, I don't have to heal actual wounds to get XP. If I just cast the spell, I get a little XP as well. It's much less, but it's something." If that is not a cheat power, I don't know what is. 'Wait, hey. Why can't I get XP when I cast my spells out of combat?' I asked her, "Do you get XP for Identify as well?" "No, just for Heal," she said with an apologizing tone. 'Of course, it is like that. Just you wait, system, I am gonna hack the shit out of you.' This unfair treatment lit a different fire in my heart. It burned just as bright as the one wanting me to get home. However, this one was different. It was the same one I always got when faced with a tough challenge.

'Speaking of, is there a role-based structure in this system as well? Gotta be, given how closely it resembles our world's technology. There must be root access as well.'

I decided to put the thought in the back of my mind for now. Everyone else had checked their attributes and stats as well. We decided to move on and explore the caves while our mana and stamina recovered. 'If this is how the fight against every crocodile goes, then this might just be the easiest level so far,' I mused.

···

The greatest difficulty in this level was not the fight against a monster; it was actually spotting one. These damn things were hibernating or something because they were never out in the open. It had been over a day and we only found 4 more crocodiles. One was halfway into the ground as if enjoying a dirt bath. It was even worse since we couldn't just run around looking for them. One snatch and grab, and we're done for.

So we moved around cautiously. Myself, Carol and Julie in the front. Flanked just behind by the rest. I did not appreciate being in the front again but I had the ability to slow down the opponent, so I did not complain. Funnily enough, the road to the next level was always perceivable. The ruins were much worse. I wondered what would happen if the Imp hordes attacked us on this terrain. Whoever designed this tutorial was being very generous.

Suddenly, Carol exclaimed, "There, on your right. See behind that rock? Me thinks that is a tail." She was right. Her speech was getting weirder by the minute though. Another monster was sleeping behind a rock quite close to us. As we explored the region, I had come to the conclusion that while Julie's sight was quite amazing, Carol was better at discerning things. Especially if they were close by.

Now that we had glimpsed our prey, we quickly changed formation. I still stayed at the front though. Julie and Arya moved behind the rest. Taro and Divin covered me, while Carol went ahead to do her thing.

The thing was slow to move, given how sleepy it was in the first place. Blasts from my spell brought it close to a standstill. And the others did the rest. Another one down. Honestly, it was so effortless that I had trouble believing it.

That was our 6th croc monster. I was earning XP between 27 - 33 per kill. I opened up my status again, out of habit. This time, I decided to hide even my spells and effects. It's not like they change much and I can always get them back when I wanted.

### [Novice] Mage - Level 2

···

It is amazing how adaptable we human beings are. The constant fight against the slime wore us down like never before. Our march through the ruins was no less strenuous. First I missed a warm bed and a hearty meal. Later, I yearned for a sip of water and just the feeling of awakening after a deep sleep. Even though I didn't need any of it. Now? It had been close to 2 days that we'd been wandering these hills. We hadn't slept *once*. Besides the short rest after killing a monster, we were constantly on the move.

That was why it wasn't long before we located the exit. This Dungeon probably went in a straight line, it seemed. We had just killed our twelfth crocodile. I reached level 3 first this time, quickly followed by the rest. Arya was still at level 2 though.

We made for the exit. Another bridge, the same as last. We went ahead and decided to rest while Arya gained her XP. I wasn't feeling like napping again. The stone floor wasn't so welcoming anyway. I decided to go for another trial and error session. This time with a different objective. I looked at Arya casting Heal on herself in succession, then waiting to recover mana. She looked at me as well, "Another spell?" she queried. "Well, not really. More like meta-spell." I answered. 'Man, I suck at explaining things.' "A meta-spell?" she shot back. "How do I explain it? Ummm... Well, never mind. I'll show you when I'm done," I took the easy way out. She chuckled an okay and I opened my Status Window editor. I cracked my knuckles, cranked my neck, took a deep breath, muttered to myself 'Here goes nothing', and dived right in!

## Chapter 13 - Timing Attack

```sh
test = echo "Hello, World!"
```

"Test," I whispered. A new window opened up.

---

### Hello, World!

---

I was almost certain that it would work but still sighed in relief. Then I quickly modified the program, coming to the crux of the issue.

```sh
test = sudo echo "Hello, World!"
```

I took a deep breath. Crossed my fingers. Whispering with my eyes closed, "Test" I opened a single eye slowly and my lips unconsciously curled into a smile.

---

### Password:

---

'Hallelujah!' I celebrated in my mind. There *is* a superuser!

"So it worked?" Arya asked out of nowhere. I beamed at her blankly for a moment. "You did your devilish smile again," she clarified.

"Okay, first off, it is a normal smile. And second, yes. I got want I was looking for. As for whether I can use it or not, the jury is still out on that one," I said.

"So, can you tell me now what the spell is?" she beamed back. She had grown peculiarly interested in programming. 'Perhaps she wants to make a powerful resurrection spell or something?'

"Okay. In normal computing, there is a concept of a superuser, who can do stuff normal users cannot. Ummm, for example, think of a corporate building. You have your cleaners, workers, security, and so on. Many people with various roles and access to different rooms and tools. Then there is the owner or an administrator of the building. That one has access to all the rooms and all the stuff of the building. A superuser is something like the administrator. I mean, bad example but close enough. In Windows, the user is called an Administrator, if I remember correctly," I tried to explain.

"Ah, I understand. So, what has your spell got to do with an admin?" she asked.

"Hmm, well you must know by now that these spells are nothing but programs, right? If I can get superuser rights, then -"

"Then you can access tools and do stuff that you normally couldn't!" she cut me off and concluded.

"Well, yes," I replied. 'She is quick on the uptake,' I thought.

"So how do you become an admin?" she continued.

"That is the problem. You need a password," I said with a bitter smile.

"Oh," she reflected back. "My mana is back up, I'm gonna go cast heal," she said and went back to her grind. I went back to mine.

···

'Brute force? Nah, I don't have the time. Hmm, will it be susceptible to attacks though? Even our Earthly systems are so air-tight for the most part, this is an alien super system we are talking about.' I was pessimistic. Good thing I had nothing but time on my hands. I decided to give it a try.

---

### Password: password

---

I added the password with a thought. The window just vanished. No 'Hello, World!'. I noticed I was down 2 mana. 'Come on, I'm not even doing anything!' I wailed.

More determined than ever, I tried several more variations. No dice.

'I can't manually keep entering a password. A few more and I'll forget what I entered previously. Nor would I be able to cover all the characters.' With that thought, I decided to automate it.

```sh
test = (while (true) (echo "password" | sudo -S echo "password worked!"))
```

I cast the spell. One mana point down. I didn't see the window prompting for the password. Another second down, another mana point gone.

'What is this? A background job? I see. Since the system is unable to determine how many resources this spell will consume, it is taking it in as it requires. But this won't do. I'm checking for the same thing over and over again. Also, I will be down to zero in fifteen minutes at this rate! And if I add checks for all combinations, god knows how long it will take,' as I fretted over the issue, another idea popped into my mind. 'What if...?'

```sh
test = (i = 0; while (i <= 255) (str = getChar[i++]; echo "$str $(time)" >> testFile; echo $str | sudo -S echo $str "worked!" ))

getChar i = awk 'BEGIN{printf "%c," i}'

time = date +%s%N
```

I ran each function and made sure everything worked. Funny it had all the utilities. By the time I was done, Arya was looking fixedly at me again. "You were gone for a while just now. What were you doing?" she queried. I was getting used to her being a curious cat by now, so I simply replied: "I'm trying something. If it works, I can modify it to get the password. Quite a shot in the dark though, I don't expect much," I sated her curiosity, "Are you done?" I queried in return. "Yep, I'm level 3 now!" she exclaimed. "Congratulations," I muttered, "Should we wake the others now or do you wanna rest some?" "Nah, let's get going," she declared. And so, we woke the others and got going.


## Chapter 14 - Avian Prosecution 1

I was getting used to the variations in the landscape by now. First the plain fields, then the ruins, finally the hills. I was almost looking forward to seeing what the upcoming level would throw at us. Whatever it was, I did not expect it to be *this*.

Slimes, Chimps, Crocs, and now... Birds? Almost anticlimactic. The terrain was also not that different from the previous level except for fewer hills and more trees. The withered old trees were populated with what looked like vultures to my eyes. They were not even that large!

"This is Level 3 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Nekhbet Copse!," Betty announced.

"These birds... They are vultures, aren't they?" Taro asserted. 'Damn right they are. Let's just ignore the chatbot and her dramatic naming sense,' I thought.

We were a bit ahead of the entrance. The shock that sneaky crocs had given us made our progress cautious but slow. Seemed like it was for naught, as our opponents were out and about, causing a ruckus with their hisses and whines. I have never heard a vulture sound before but I'm betting they aren't as loud as these.

"Yeah, they look like vultures," Julie stepped up, "There are a lot of them on the tree and below. They might swarm us like the slimes. How should we proceed?"

After some discussion, we decided to let the knights take point. Carol just behind them. Julie went at the end of the formation. Arya and I stood back, deciding to not interfere this time.

Soon, the tree was within shooting distance of the vanguard. Julie notched her arrow and fired at the largest vulture in the group. The birds suddenly went quiet. Her target was near the top of the tree. Her arrow landed about a couple of meters below it. 'Getting good,' I thought. She *was* a fair distance away from her target, so it was impressive.

The birds weren't impressed, however. With a low guttural hiss, the big guy swooped down and headed towards Julie. The rest of the flock of perhaps ten to fifteen followed behind it.

Our four companions admirably stood their ground. Carol intercepted the large bird with her daggers. Just as they were about to pierce the belly, the bird changed directions with a flap of its wings and dodged. The dagger scratched its tail nonetheless, just as its claws scraped past her wrists. Taro and Divin were doing better. Each one was hounded by three or four birds but it didn't seem like a major issue. Their swords had more reach after all. One vulture was already down. I noticed it was hit by Divin's freeze Skill.

Just as the rest of the fowls reached the group, I joined the fight as well. I feared they might outnumber us and we'd have to run away again. The largest was still harassing Carol, while Julie had distanced herself a bit more from the chaos and was now shooting at the dissenters. She got in a hit now and then. Taro and Divin held their ground. I noticed Arya had arrived behind Julie as well, checking if her help was needed.

As for me, I immediately leaped behind Carol and froze the big bird. It was startled and missed its attack. At that moment, I blasted another freezing spell at it. It was in vain though, as Carol's dagger was deep in its heart by then. It barely made a hiss and plunked on the ground. Within seconds, it disappeared in a storm of feathers, leaving behind a tattered cloth that must have been a shirt before it was mutilated.

···

The balance for this level was tilted in our favor. The addition of an extra Knight was nothing to scoff at! Now that I think about it, having 3 front-liners had nothing but helped us all these levels. I wonder what would have happened if instead of a Knight, we had a Craftsman. How would it have affected our fights?

Either way, the vultures did not present any big difficulty. The beaks and claws were sharp, perhaps even more so than the Imps, but that was it. Sure they could fly, but they couldn't attack from the air. They *had* to come down if they wanted to hurt us. And up close, we had better reach and sharper weapons. Their numbers didn't mean much when only a few could attack at a time.

Pretty soon, the rest of the carrion-feeders were gone. I had helped cool down a few more of them after the first. The way their bodies turned into a small tornado of feathers after they died was a sight to behold. There were other tattered clothes dropped. A hat and another shirt, quite past their shelf life.

Everyone had a relaxed smile on their faces. With the sudden-death threat from sneaky 20 feet monsters lifted, we breathed slightly easy. Sure, these guys gave us the most trouble so far, but it was not much danger. Unlike the Imps, their cuts were deeper. They also fought more harmoniously in a group. That was it though. We could take them!

We decided to rest up beneath the tree. Not that we needed shade in the ever-evening. Arya had healed Carol and she moved towards me. "Nah, I'm okay. Heal those two first," I pointed her to Divin and Taro. They took the brunt of the attack and had more cuts than others. "OK," she smiled and moved on to heal Taro.

I, on the other hand, opened up my Status Window to check the gains.

### [Novice] Mage - Level 3

| HP      | MP     | SP   | XP      |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| 103/150 | 34/950 | 2/35 | 136/400 |

---

I already had just under 60 extra from the previous level. 'If I helped kill say, 6 of the birds, then I am getting about 12 or 13 XP per kill', I mused, 'Not bad, I guess'.

After attaining level 3, I could cast Petrificus four times in a row. However, it rarely worked the fourth time. 'I wonder if there is a job I can run that will keep on decreasing the temperature to as low as possible? Or even increase it? Will have to loop on it. I wonder how long it will take to kick in though? Well, no harm in trying out anyway'. I opened up my "spell repository" and quickly added a spell to decrease temperature slowly. I also renamed the time function to make it a bit consistent.

---

```

incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)

petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = x.temperature / 2)

identify o = (echo o)

test = (i = 0; while (i <= 255) (str = getChar[i++]; echo "$str $(getTime)" >> file; echo $str | sudo -S echo $str "worked!" ))

getChar i = awk 'BEGIN{printf "%c", i}'

getTime = date +%s%N

petrificus_slowly x = (while (true) x.temperature--)

```

---

···

As I was about to add another function to increase the temperature, I heard Divin call out to me. He had sneaked close while I was looking into the window. The rest were still frolicking about below the tree. I was more surprised by the fact that he took initiative to call me out. "Hey, what's up?" I queried.

"What were you and Arya talking about?" he asked with a straight face. I did not understand what he was talking about. Perhaps noticing my befuddlement, he elaborated, "On the last bridge and the one before, when the rest of us were sleeping." 'I guess not all of you were sleeping, eh?' I thought to myself. "Ah that. You see she and I, being a Healer and Mage, can access our editors to create new spells. That is what we were discussing. Everything okay?" I asked. "Yes," he said impassively and walked away. 'What that was about?' I wondered.

I decided to move as well, we had birds to hunt!

## Chapter 15 - Avian Prosecution 2

Looking back on it, I was astonished that killing living beings en masse was not enough to deter me from moving forward. Leaving this place was enough motivation at first, but later on, I doubt that was true. Perhaps I just didn't care anymore? The mental acclimation sure was working its magic. Carol and Divin didn't think twice before attacking. I had no room for hesitation myself since I was critical support. However, I did see Taro and Julie fighting a losing battle against creeping apathy. I wonder how Arya would've fared if she wasn't a Healer. Her poking at a small vulture with her staff when it tried to attack Julie from the side made it clear she was being affected too, more or less.

This vulture level was the hardest fight we had to fight so far. The monsters came in greater numbers and frequency. They were slightly more powerful than the imps, though I still couldn't see their levels. We were left with a mess of bleeding cuts, many of them deep, after every fight.

Despite all that, our spirits were high. There was no threat of an ambush or death. We were all raking in quite a load of XP. At the end of our fourth fight, the biggest vulture dropped gloves that were not utterly destroyed! Julie claimed them citing her hurt fingers due to constant sniping. All things considered, we were moving at a steady pace. Eventually, Arya reached level 4. The one next was yours truly. I quickly opened my Status Window in the break that followed and made it show all my attributes.

'Whoa, 1000 mana? That's a good number!' A quick check on spells after recovering some mana revealed my range was now around 9 meters. Incendio consumed 250 points, while Petrificus ate 200. 'That means I can reduce the temperature by half five times... If it is 100, it will come down to 3 degrees!?! Nah, that'll never work though.' I was now quite clear on the workings of these spells. If it seemed too good to be true, it probably was.

···

We followed a similar stratagem in the copse as we did in the ruins. We would encounter a flock of vultures whenever we came across a bunch of trees. After the fight, we would rest in the shade for a while then move on. Quite simple really, no great tricks involved.

My progress to level 4, especially my increased range, meant that now I no longer needed to be in the midst of things to work my magic. While I was still uncomfortably close to the fight, I was not dangerously so. At least not against the creatures we were facing now.

Arya on the other hand was now able to cast heals near consistently. During the last 3 fights and the calm that followed, she took only 2 breaks to recover mana. Many deep cuts and multiple heal spells per cut, yet only 2 breaks! Her range hadn't taken a big leap as mine though, so she still needed to be within a meter or so to heal. She seemed to have stopped sulking at some point. Perhaps having to constantly care for people around her alleviated her mindset.

Julie was actually shooting stuff! I do not know how Skills affect physiology in this place, but her progress was astounding. She could now hit a stationary object within 15 meters 7 times out of 10! She was no longer moving forward on impulse. Ever since we talked about the time dilation, her step has been light yet firm. A definite purpose.

In sharp contrast to Julie was Taro. I have never seen that guy seem down in the past week I've known him. His carefree attitude continued. His Skills with the sword were now quite improved, however. He didn't seem like a toddler with a knife anymore. At least not to my amateur eyes. His swings seemed more sleek and sharp. He was just behind Carol, who got the most final killing blows in.

Speaking of Carol, she was no longer upset. Or she was hiding it pretty well. Either way, I was spot-on about her personality. She conversed with everyone about everything. Even Divin! I wondered how she managed that. During battle though, she was the most focused of any of us. I had a slightly irrational fear of her daggers in my heart. She was fun to talk to though; she and I were even cracking bad jokes now and then.

Almost everyone laughed at those jokes or at least smiled slightly if not outright giggle. Everyone except Divin. I have been with this guy for over a week now and still can't figure out what's going on in his nugget. After our talk last time, he hadn't spoken to me about it again. Almost as if it never happened. His skill, however, was solid. Despite being a front-liner, he seemed to be taking a supporting role. Sure he killed many more than myself and Arya combined. But he rarely went in for the kill. His freeze Skill came in quite handy though. It didn't freeze as much or as fast as my spell, but it worked quite well nonetheless.

Our progress was efficient. A while after me, Carol leveled up. Immediately following her, Taro did as well. Divin soon joined the club. Only Julie was left in level 3, but she was pretty close as well. A third of her arrows were gone.

In fact, even her bow was showing signs of its usage. The bowstring had spouted small tendrils at the ends. Taro and Divin's swords had small chips on the edges. Only Arya's staff was somewhat undamaged. All our clothes were now quite dirty, with various cuts and stripes. It was worst for the knights. While we could hold on, for now, I wondered how we would fight the monsters in latter levels with tattered clothes and broken weapons. 'At least my spells will not degrade with time or usage,' I consoled myself.

···

"It has been 7 days, 9 hours, and 36 minutes since we began from Spawn Point!" Betty's voice intoned. We were close to the exit of level 3. The vultures had been the greatest XP harvest so far. Arya was even halfway to level 5!

I wasn't half bad myself. I bet everyone else had accrued quite a lot as well. Except perhaps Julie. She reached level 4 not long before we sighted the exit. We were now taking our customary nap on the abyss bridge. I decided to sleep as well, given I had not slept for over 4 days now!

I wasn't asleep for long when I woke up again. Perhaps it was the constant fighting in this weird world, but I slept quite lightly. I felt something move off to my side. I opened my eyes to see a flustered Arya shuffling beside me. I looked up at her. She smiled apologetically and whispered, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up."

"It's alright, I wasn't sleeping deeply anyway. What's up?" I asked and glanced quickly at Divin. He seemed asleep, but I wasn't fooled.

"Ah, did you find the password to admin?" she asked.

"Oh... Nah, that didn't pan out! The longer that spell runs, the more resources it takes. I don't have that much mana, so it abruptly ends without any proper output." I muttered. The while loop with constant calculations consumed 1 or 2 mana per second as long as it ran. But when I changed the test program to append output to file, it started off with 3 mana but within the next few seconds, it was taking up to 10 mana points per second and continued its upward trend. No way I could sustain it. Also, the file wiped itself if the program didn't conclude successfully. So, after the first time when I ran it and consumed all MP I had, I didn't run it again. I did keep in the repo, just in case.

"I see... That's too bad." she sputtered back, her face crestfallen. I didn't wanna leave the conversation hanging just like that, so I decided to ask a random question that popped into my head. "What do you think the next level is gonna be like?"

Before she could answer though, Taro was up. We looked at him, he smiled in return before sneaking over to us and whispering, "I hope its a volcano! Also, we can fight a dragon there."

'This guy!' I suppressed a chuckle. "You know we are barely able to fight vultures here, if a dragon comes up, we're dead meat." I could see his eyes were still shining. 'I would like to see a dragon though.'

We did such small talk until eventually, Julie woke up. Divin, who I assumed was pretending to sleep, woke up as well. Not Carol though, we had to drag her back from her dreamland.

We made our march to the entrance of level 4. Even from the bridge, I could see the dense undergrowth that lay beyond. A level of a forest, I presumed. A sense of foreboding shook my nerves as we stepped onwards.

## Chapter 16 - Mini-Boss?

As we stepped past the entrance and inched our way towards the trees, I noticed that this level was slightly different than all the previous ones. The dusky light that had accompanied us so far seemed to have given way to darker shades of itself. A heavy fog hung over the arena, getting denser inside the trees. The trees themselves were rooted quite close together and looked uninviting. Unlike the withered old bunch of the last level, these ones were teeming with vitality. Dark green leaves swayed silently to the tender breeze that shifted the fog ever so slightly. The terrain felt alive. Dangerously so.

Everyone else was similarly affected. Carol no longer dared to go ahead to Scout. We were all bunched together, moving as one organism. Poor formation for combat but no one suggested otherwise. As we stood a few steps before the first tree, a slight hesitation numbed our progress. 'Should we just head inside? Is there any way to Scout? What if we get ambushed? There is no way to counter here.' Worries plagued my mind. I wondered what sort of monsters inhabited such a dark and intense place.

"Should we just... Get on with it?" Julie whispered. True, there was a small track going through the woods. 'Thank the creators for this mercy!' "We don't have any other choice," Taro mumbled. Unfortunately, the track was small enough that only 2 people could fit in tightly across. Little discussion was required before we fell into formation - Taro and Divin up front, myself and Arya in the middle, and Carol and Julie covering the rear. Arya had loaned her staff to Julie. Everyone had their weapons drawn.

Our cautious footsteps made no sound on the soft undergrowth. The fog surrounding us afforded the view of a few trees around us, but it seemed to grow slightly thicker with every step forward. A slight wind made a few leaves shiver, and my heart started beating faster. Thankfully the rustling died quickly and I took an easy breath. It was at that moment that our only source of light decided to make an announcement - "This is level 4 of the Dungeon, Lair of Panthera!"

···

The moment she said it, we all stopped and bunched up even closer. Glancing around frantically in all directions revealed no monster. There was a pin drop silence as we stood rigid waiting for something to snap at our heels. The image of monstrous crocs was still fresh in our minds. Seconds slipped by, nothing happened. After a couple of minutes of a tense standoff with mute fog, Taro took a tentative step forward. Divin slowly followed. Both of them had their swords raised in either direction. I was not far behind. With Taro's lead, everyone started shambling ahead. No sign of enemy so far. Yet no one spoke, not even a sound.

Suddenly I heard another rustle somewhere behind me. Others did as well, as we all halted our reluctant march. Just as I turned around to see what was up, a shadow leaped out from the bushes at Carol. She was quick to raise her arms and hold the daggers to defend herself. I saw as it overpowered her stance with pure strength as she fell on her butt. The shadow jumped again, with the intent of disappearing in the darkness on the other side. It succeeded in knocking down Julie on the way, the staff breaking like a twig. Soon it disappeared and silence reigned.

Julie was unhurt - Arya's staff took the brunt of the force. Carol, on the other hand, was bleeding profusely. She had deep long scars on her forearms. One of her daggers was lost. It was the best outcome for her, given the situation. The thing had lunged at her throat; her falling ironically saved her life. It was quite a close call. Arya was stacking heal upon heal on her wounds. Us guys were covering the women from three sides, keeping a close lookout for the shadow.

Just one encounter and we lost two weapons. One of us as hurt as well; luckily with non-fatal injuries. This level was not looking so good. It was a testament to our hardened will that none of us made a run for it. It must've been exactly what the creature wanted, so it could pick us off one by one.

A good minute and Carol's wounds were halfway healed. We changed the formation again. This time, I was taking Carol's place holding one half of the staff. Julie stood beside me. We had formed a crude sort of circle, having an eyeball in every direction. No one moved. No one spoke. We all waited with bated breath for this mysterious foe to attack again.

···

"In front," Divin whispered under his breath. Everyone turned and looked in the direction our path was heading. There I saw yellow eyes surrounded by dark fur. The eyes were reflecting the glow of Betty who was hovering behind us. Nothing else could be seen in the fog. I gulped unconsciously at the ghastly scene. Once the creature saw that our attention was pinned on it, it made a low guttural growl and vanished again. 'Fucker is toying with us!'

"A black panther," Divin whispered. I noticed his voice quiver a bit. "It's baiting us," I grunted. "What's our plan?" Carol murmured. No one answered for a few seconds. Gears were turning in everyone's brains. 'It is not as powerful as the crocodiles, so it cannot one-shot us - at least I hope so. It is however faster, stronger, and stealthier than everything else we have faced before. Also, this forest feels like its home terrain. It's too fast for me to cast a spell-chain. Only close-quarter weapons have a chance, but it uses hit-and-run tactics. We can only defend for now.' "We can only defend for now," I said out loud. No one responded, but they all held their weapons tighter.

Not a moment after I said that did we hear another rustle, this time from Taro's side. Immediately, I moved closer to him. Broken staff in one hand, palms held up for the other. Divin moved to his side. Others took a step close as well. The panther jumped out again, but instead of attacking, it feinted. Perhaps us cramming together made it change its mind. This, however, was a golden opportunity for me. I immediately followed the shadow with my palm and cast incendio.

I was 250 mana lighter. The spell was cast successfully. However, I did not get any XP notification. As expected though, it would be too easy if it died to a single incendio. However, its speed ensured I'd never get a chance to cast another. We waited in a tight formation for 5 minutes more but no other attack came. 'It must be recovering from the spell's damage. It will be warier now that it knows we can hurt it.'

Several more minutes passed by. We decided to move on. No point in staying in one place for too long. While it did take us by surprise the first time, now we knew the sign of its approach. We could perhaps scare it off. 'Wait, how many of these panthers are there? Also, how are we supposed to level up and reach the next level if we can't kill them?' I got lost in my new scary thoughts, arguably not the best time to be absent-minded. I got my lesson soon when I was a second too late to notice the rustling sound which sounded awfully close to me. I could do nothing but barely raise the staff in my hand when the furious yellow-eyed shadow leaped on me. Everything moved in slow motion. 'Am I going to die? This feels so weird!' The thing hadn't even touched me when I stumbled backward and fell. Out the corner of my eye, I noticed a sword thrusting ahead. The shadow deftly avoided the straight blade by leaning it slightly and having it slide through its tough fur. And then it landed on me.

Just as its claws dug deep into my stomach, I had a moment of clarity. 'I am so *stupid*!!!' I had a spell to counter it all along. 'Too bad I won't get a chance to use it. I hope these guys make it through somehow.' I didn't care much about death now. Yeah, I was scared of dying at first, but then realized where I was. I was even slightly glad that it was me that was going. 'Soon, I'll be back home!' I thought and closed my eyes.

## Chapter 17 - Curse Series

I jolted awake to a numbing pain in my abdomen. I had no idea what was going on. I opened my eyes to see some girl flashing a torchlight on my torso with tears in her eyes. For some reason, I felt her tears were more out of fright than worry for me. 'Why do I even care about that?' I wondered. Some dude with a sword was glancing around and then at me with furrowed brows. 'What is *he* mad about?' I thought. Tilting my head, I saw a few more people standing around with their backs to me. While they were just standing, I could feel the tension in their stance. Or was it fear? Another guy with a sword was actively quaking in his boots. 'What are they all looking for?' I eventually managed to sit up after some difficulty. The pain didn't make it any easier. 'Why is my shirt all torn up? Wait... Is that blood? What the hell is...' and then reality hit me like a cold shower.

I was still here. I was still alive. The panther gouged out my intestines - or so I felt, and I quickly fainted. The torchlight was Arya casting healing on me non-stop. Thankfully, I was past the worst. Not bleeding anymore. 'Healing magic is really overpowered here.' Everything felt weirdly squishy though. Not to mention long scars that decorated my stomach. I noticed them through my tattered shirt. The shirt looked more like a crop-top now. I calmed Arya down, asking her to slow the constant barrage of heals coming my way and explain what happened.

Must've been about 5 minutes since I was mauled. Divin was the one who thrust his sword at it first. While the feline did dodge and escape being pierced, there was cold damage that it could not escape. Not to mention Taro's sharp strike to its side. Even Carol manage to scrape it with her only dagger. All in all, we managed to hurt it more this time around. Although we got more than we gave. It hadn't attacked since - licking its wounds perhaps. I was badly hurt but it wasn't immediately fatal. Back home, if I couldn't get urgent medical assistance, I would have died very slowly and very painfully. That sort of wound it was. The others were clearly rattled. This was the first time since coming here that any of us got so close to dying. Not to mention our current situation - hopeless was an adequate description for it. 'Speaking of hopeless...' I had a small smile on my lips. Arya looked at me like I'd lost my mind. Divin, who was still slightly frowning for some reason, queried: "You have a plan?" 'Damn right I do!'

···

"You okay? How do you feel?" she asked. Perhaps she *was* worried about me. "I feel like I got my guts gouged out!" I joked. She wasn't amused. "Ahem.. I'll be alright. Thanks," I placated her, "And yeah, Divin. I do have a plan." The others were listening in on our conversation and I could feel the tension lessen a bit. Carol's shoulders visibly slouched as she asked, "What be the plan?"

One reason we couldn't land extensive damage on the creature was because it was too damn fast. I could barely cast a single spell. For my spells to take full effect I had to cast them multiple times in a row. I had no idea why doubling or halving the temperature didn't cause any significant issue to these creatures. 'Oh wait... Magical Resistance, Duh!!!' Of course. I even had an attribute that was directly related to magic resistance. I just couldn't make the connection because it never came up. I was never magically attacked! It is not unreasonable to assume that monsters had resistances as well. 'Ah! That is why the imps basically shrugged off my heat spells. They probably had very high resistance to it. Makes sense.' As for our current feline problem, I had just the spell to use. One attack is all I need. It will stick on like a leech and keep reducing the temperature, as low as it can go! This was less of a spell and more of a *curse*.

As I explained my curse spell to the team, I could see their hopes rise. "It does take a while to affect though, even I'm not sure how long. So I suggest we don't let it slip by next time. Divin, Taro & Carol can follow it in the forest as it retreats. Then you can finish it off." "Why are we splitting up?" Taro asked. "Well, two reasons. First, if all of us go in, we could get lost in the fog. If we split up, half of Betty will remain here and act as a lighthouse. Second, there is no point for all of us to go. I am injured and will only slow you down, Arya is a Healer so she can't help in a kill - about healing, I doubt you'd get injured as the thing will be freezing and in no condition to fight by the time you get close to it, and Julie has no close-range weapons." I explained my reasoning.

I opened up my Status Window to see my health was down to 61 but rising rapidly. Arya had restarted her heal, though with lesser frenzy. 'I wonder how low I went?' No time for that though. The tension in the air was now at its lowest since the attack. It must've been a few hours since we entered the forest. Thankfully, the fog didn't get any denser and our vision of a few meters around us remained intact. With a plan to subdue our foe, we cautiously made our way ahead.

···

"It has been 15 hours and 21 minutes since we entered level 4!" Betty replied to my question. The panther had left us alone so far. Too bad for it, it did not have a magical Healer on its side. We had continued our slow and steady march through the foggy forest. We didn't stop at all. Our stats were all full and we were primed and ready for any action.

If the previous levels were any indication, I'd say we were more than halfway through this one. The chances of being attacked were increasing with every step we took. So did our vigilance. We were back in our original formation. I started wondering when the thing would show up when I heard the slight tell-tale rustle. It came from the right, towards Taro. We all ganged up within a moment. It lunged at Taro's throat. We had discussed earlier how to avoid getting our guts or throats ripped off. Following the same, Taro crouched down, almost hugging his knees, and held his sword up. The panther fell on him, using his back as a launchpad to leap at Divin. Just as it was about to jump off, I moved my palm towards it and shouted, "PETRIFICUS_SLOWLY!"

The panther was startled to hear my raised voice. Like a veteran though, it immediately changed its trajectory and decided to retreat. Unfortunately for it, the damage was done. Arya hastily cast a couple of heals on Taro. Within a few seconds, he was disappeared in the fog following Divin and Carol. Sudden silence assaulted our ears, and I took a calming breath. I had done what needed to be done. I flipped my finger up and noticed the rate of mana consumption. 'I guess it started off with 10 mana per second like usual but now it is consuming 13... Oh wait, it is 19 now. 19. 19. 19. 19.. 24!' Every few seconds, it jumped up by some amount. It must've been about 50 seconds later when it stopped. Towards the end, it was consuming more mana at a faster rate, concluding by leaving 408 points intact. A quick calculation revealed the curse had taken 592 mana in about a minute. 'Not bad, I guess. As long as it worked.' I closed my stat window and sat down leaning against a tree. Muck was no longer an issue, my clothes couldn't get dirtier.

Must've been a couple of minutes after I sat down that I suddenly felt like I had leveled up and more. Looking across the two girls revealed a similar reaction. 'They did it!' I thought and opened up my Status Window to look at my gains.

---

'Oh, I got extra points on Perception and Wisdom. Cool! Hey, did I get exactly 500 exp? I had 324/500 before entering this level.'

Talking with Julie and Arya revealed they had gotten an extra Skill each. Arya had gotten something similar to group heal. All allies within a certain distance from her would automatically heal when the Skill was active. It appeared to be weaker than her normal heal though. For Julie, it was something called True Shot. The description was a bit vague but it seemed like some sort of homing mechanism. She tried it out on a nearby tree and hit *exactly* the spot she was aiming at. "It costs all my mana though," she lamented. However, I could tell she wasn't upset about it - quite the opposite. It was truly a game-changer for her.

Soon the rest of the gang returned. With souvenirs, no less. They had a new sword, a set of daggers, a staff, bow & arrows, and some sort of ring. Also, 6 distinct unisex apparel. Everything was of a higher quality than what Betty had provided for us. I picked up a brown robe-like piece that screamed 'Mage' and put it on. The rest divided the stuff among themselves. Apparently, the equipment was for 6 base Classes. After some discussion, I decided to keep the ring. It must've been meant for craftsmen, there was some worn motif on it. It could be enchanted, I could study it. Further discussion revealed each of us had acquired exactly 500 XP. All of us were now "Competent". Divin received the sharp Skill that Taro already possessed, while Taro got a wind-related Skill. It let the cut from a swing extend beyond the physical edge. Carol on the other hand received something similar to Julie's True Shot, except it was for daggers.

Everyone changed their clothes and equipped their weapons in their private corner behind the trees. A few more hours of light trekking got us to the exit of this level. No one hesitated to step beyond. This time, the bridge was different. It was wide enough to allow two cars to run parallel with space in between. It also looked properly built and well maintained. I immediately slumped over and fell asleep by the side. Almost dying is quite taxing on your mind, I learned.

## Chapter 18 - The Mage Situation

"... found it, it was just lying down. Its breath was forming a mist. We finished it off together. Then it turned into a shadow-like whoosh and disappeared. Next thing I know, we find all this stuff just lying around underneath." I heard Taro's animated voice as soon as I woke up. "Yeah, and soon as 'twas dead, I got a Class upgrade. Out of nowhere, I'm a competent Scout! And I got this cool dagger Skill as well. All better that I got more daggers." Carol continued. I got up and looked around. Everyone was awake, waiting for me. 'Nice of them,' I thought.

We didn't wait for long before starting our march ahead. We were still near the start of the bridge, and this one was slightly longer than all the previous ones. Our feet no longer dragged with the burden of our straining experience - instead, our stride held renewed determination. No doubt spurred by the new clothes, equipment, and Classes. Walking without having to worry about ambush made my mind wander. 'I'm a competent Mage now. But unlike others, I have no special Skills. So the only thing I got is the extra points? Surely not. Betty mentioned a qualitative change! By the way, why doesn't a Mage Class have any Skills?' I wondered.

···

"Say, Betty, why don't Mage have Skills?" (Me)

"Skills for the Mage Class were deprecated 84 versions ago when a test subject caused anomalies in the test run." (Betty-the-wisp intoned)

"What anomalies?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that." (Betty)

'I see, so another programmer was kidnapped before me and they messed with the test somehow. The creators then decided to nerf the Class so no one else could take advantage similarly!'

"Why not just remove the Mage Class then?" (Me)

"Mage Class is one of the base Classes of the simulation and deeply entrenched in the storyline. Removing it is infeasible." (Betty)

"Makes sense. But what about the test subjects who selected Mage is last 84 versions. How did they make it out of the tutorial?" (Me)

"They didn't." (Betty)

'Ouch'

"So are mages limited similarly in the outer world as well?" (Me)

"No, the limitations apply only to test subjects." (Betty)

"What's the outer world like anyway?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that." (Betty)

'Of course, explore and experience'

"But what is the point of this test though? What is the aim? How does it end?" (Me)

"The main storyline will be explained by the characters when you arrive there." (Betty, seemingly moving away from me as if she didn't like my questions)

"What about the Class upgrade? Wasn't there supposed to be qualitative change? All I got were some extra points!" (Me, returning to a hopefully favorable topic)

"You have received a higher privilege level of interacting with the environment with the Class upgrade. It also raised the priority of resources allocated to you." (Betty)

'Interesting...'

"Care to explain more?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot." (Betty, deadpanned)

'Of course, you can't. The creators must really hate programmers for whatever hell my predecessor raised. I guess I'll have to find out for myself.'

···

So far, I had somehow made it with temperature-related spells. But that could only take me so far. 'First on my list is to increase my spell repo variety.' Also, I needed to find out what Betty meant by higher privilege and resource priority. A thought suddenly struck me as we were rounding a corner. Yeah, there was a turn on the bridge! I lifted my hand and pointed my palm towards Julie who was walking ahead of me. "Identify," I whispered. I noticed that I could intuitively feel what my range was, not having to test it out. "12 meters, looks like." Also, a new window opened up with Julie's status

---

### [Competent] Archer - Level 5

*Special Effects*

* Telescopic Sight: You can see further away without losing any details.
* Physical Boost 2: You get extra Dexterity, Agility, and/or Stamina on every Class upgrade.

*Skills*

* Rapid Fire: Shoot multiple arrows successively with little delay, increasing fire rate.
* True Shot: Arrow hones in on a target, greatly increasing the chance of a successful hit.

---

'Whoa! I can see Skills now? Neat!'

I immediately cast 'Identify' on others. 'Somehow feels like I'm violating their privacy though.' Nobody stopped me but I decided not to cast it again without permission. That being said, I noticed everyone had at least 2 special effects and Skills. One of the effects was always Boost of some kind.

'I wonder what else has changed?'

As I was lost in my thoughts, the entrance to level 5 came up. We quickly decided to continue. No one wanted to stay in this place for more than necessary. This was no sightseeing trip. Not that there was much to see anyway. I shelved my unnecessary thoughts and decided to create a to-do list, in the repo itself.

```sh
todo = (echo "* Increase spell variety\n* Check changes from Class upgrade")
```

'todo sounds very... normal. Since I'm here, might as well go all out!' I changed the function name from 'todo' to 'questlist'.

We were still near the entrance. Betty hadn't announced anything. I decided to do a quick check. Looking around to ensure there was no threat, I muttered under my breath - "questlist."

---

* Increase spell variety
* Check changes from Class upgrade

---

'Looks good! Lost 1 mana point as usual.' I closed the window, took a deep breath, and focused on the upcoming fight.


## Chapter 19 - Speed Levelling 1

On level 5 we encountered a grassland filled with insectoids that were a cross between beetles and grasshoppers. Incendio worked quite well against them.

Level 6 saw us facing a swarm of overgrown snakes. Easy pickings. Arya broke her staff though, whilst thrashing the ground around a particularly agile snake.

Level 7 pitted us against cute but annoying hummingbird-like monsters. Ironically, they gave us more trouble than the vipers. Julie was down to half her arrows.

When we found the gorilla type monsters on level 8, it almost felt too easy. Sure they were a bit more intelligent. Yes, they ambushed and swarmed us every now and then. But it was all for naught. Taro's sword broke in this level and he got reluctant experience in using a short-sword.

Nothing but smooth sailing all these levels. I didn't invest time in any more experiments. We barely took any naps on the bridges. Somewhere along the way, Carol had lost another dagger.

Our merry band of test subjects had become a monster-slaying juggernaut, nigh unstoppable.

Now we stood in front of the entrance to level 9. While recent victories ingrained a dash of vanity in our steps, our close call in the last boss battle tempered our hubris. I decided to do a quick check on my stats and attributes.

---

### [Competent] Mage - Level 9

| Status     | Points    |
|------------|-----------|
| Health     | 290/290   |
| Mana       | 1200/1200 |
| Stamina    | 50/50     |
| Experience | 129/1000  |

| Attributes   | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Strength     | 10     |
| Vitality     | 10     |
| Agility      | 10     |
| Dexterity    | 11     |
| Intelligence | 18     |
| Perception   | 12     |
| Wisdom       | 12     |

---

'Hmm, numbers are rounding off nicely,' I reflected. 'How about my repository?'

---

```

incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)

petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = x.temperature / 2)

identify o = (echo o)

test = (i = 0; while (i <= 255) (str = getChar[i++]; echo "$str $(getTime)" >> file; echo $str | sudo -S echo $str "worked!" ))

getChar i = awk 'BEGIN{printf "%c", i}'

getTime = date +%s%N

petrificus_slowly x = (while (true) x.temperature--)

questlist = (echo "* Increase spell variety\n* Check changes from Class upgrade")

```

---

Incendio took 200 MP, while Petrificus took 170; Identify was down to 20. I did not get another chance to cast a curse again after the panther encounter. 'Oh, that's right - I have to write incendio_slowly yet.' "test" and "questlist" were not so useful so far. My range was somewhere around 20 meters. While my spell toolkit was low on variety, that would be remedied in time. I no longer had any lingering regrets of choosing the Mage Class.

My Class-up did have certain effects that I hadn't noticed before. Whilst earlier I could select target ranging from a blade of grass to a big rock, now I could select partial objects as well. Like half a blade of grass or only one side of a rock. I could select my spells to affect a certain body part of the monsters. This precise control also extended to my ability to select a region. Earlier while I tried freezing the ground, I could only guess what area was actually affected, unlike now where I could select it.

As I wondered about this, Julie took a nervous step forward. I shook my head to clear it of protracted thoughts and joined her. Well rested and primed for action, we entered to meet our fate.

···

This arena of level 9 was no bigger than level 0; smaller than that even. Instead of slimes, however, this place was inhabited by a single large being resting right in the center. Its snores lifted what little dirt remained on the ground into the air. Even sleeping, it exuded an attitude of owning this place. Or perhaps uncaring of whoever did.

From afar, it looked like a big ball of fur. We ventured in further guardedly, ready to flee at a moment's notice. Soon the monster came into view.

What looked like a ball of fur turned out to be a creature that had gone extinct from Earth - a freaking mammoth. And it was HUGE!

While we were all in plain sight of the beast, it was still in its merry dreams. Betty hadn't made an announcement yet, so perhaps this time, *we* could be the predators doing sneak attacks!

Julie was right beside me. She notched her arrow and looked at me. I nodded my head. She took her aim while I looked at others to ensure they were set to retreat. Then I looked at the napping fur ball and waiting in anticipation.

*whiz* the arrow flew. Apparently, Julie used her True Shot Skill, as the head flew true and struck the monstrosity right on its forehead. And tumbled down its tusk. The sloth didn't even twitch.

"Damn, the thing has got some thick skin!" exclaimed Taro. We were losing our stiff demeanor. All our caution seemed wasted.

We were still quite a bit away from the mammoth. In fact, we were much closer to the entrance than it. At a loss for what to do next, I suggested I'd check out magic attack. After Julie, I had the best range. Everyone agreed.

As I tiptoed closer, I truly grasped just how big the monster was. Its tusk was long enough to skewer me straight through. And I was about to rudely wake the behemoth from its peaceful slumber.

Thinking back on my similar encounter with crocs, I gave another thought to what spell I should use. Freezing one wouldn't work, obviously. But the heated one wouldn't affect much either. A curse could work, given enough mana. Unfortunately, I had no good spell against the giant. I decided to just go for a chain of Incendio. But first - "Identify!"

---

### Yakawawiak - Level ?

*Special Effect*

* Transient Life: You are a temporary variable in a short-lived calculation

*Skill*

* Tusk Rush: With a burst of unnatural speed and a flash of your ivory weapon, rabble of enemies are left behind in pieces in your wake.

---

'What in the hell is that name?' I was in disbelief. However, I was not swayed from my goal - the giant loaf mere 20 meters ahead of me granted no such respite.

"Incendio! Incendio! Incendio! Incendio! Incendio! Incendio!" I jabbered. I had used my new Skills to aim right at the eyelid. As soon as the last word escaped my lips, I ran with all my might back to the entrance. My companions had already made themselves scarce.

Just as I reached the entrance, I heard Betty's declaration as her splinter merged with her original: "This is level 9 of the Tutorial Dungeon - Yakawawiak's Pit!"

We watched with abject fascination as the hulking frame was lifted off the ground. I had a feeling the beast was staring right at me, with one eye red. I checked my mana points - 400 remaining. So four of the spells hit home. And all they did was give it an itch. This was going to be a difficult fight.

···

"Spells didn't do much damage. Just like the arrow." (Me)

"Yeah. And now it's awake and waiting for us with vengeance. Although, it looks wee dumb." (Carol observed)

"Oh yeah, but it's got a rush Skill like those vipers." (Me)

"Good to know. Identify is quite useful. Wonder if we can get it on upgrade?" (Taro)

"Any ideas on killing it?" (Divin)

"My arrows are no help here. I can probably distract it but that's all." (Julie, slouching)

"I doubt we will win by attacking head-on." (Me)

"I think so too. Perhaps we can lay a trap or something" (Arya)

"A pitfall could work." (Divin)

"Aye, but who's gonna dig such big hole. And I doubt the thing will just let us do whatever." (Carol)

'Ah, so this is how craftsmen could help.' (Me, to myself)

"Assuming we could build a pitfall and lure the thing in, how are we going to kill it? The only weakness seems to be its eyes. I guess its belly could be as well. We gotta trap it upside down or sideways somehow." (Me sharing my train of thought)

"We can dig a pit just enough for its legs. If it works correctly, it will tumble over. As for luring it, it has been eyeballing you ever since it woke up." (Divin, turning to me)

'Does this guy want me dead or something?' "How are we going to dig a pit though?" (Me, parroting Carol)

"I will help you distract it Pat. As for the pit, we've got no choice but to use swords and daggers. Thankfully, the ground is not too hard." (Julie)

"I don't think it will work. Digging a pit with just swords, I mean." (Me)

"Do you have a better plan?" (Divin)

"Hmm no. Guess we can at least try this one." (Me, preparing myself for the worst)

And so Julie and I went inside the pit where the mammoth was waiting for us. I went right, she went left. The beast stood still in the center, but its eyes were tracking me for sure. As I stood about 60 meters away from it, the beast nonchalantly turned its head towards me.

"So it begins," I whispered to myself, primed for flight.

## Chapter 20 - Speed Levelling 2

Just as I had gone right, Julie went left. My attention was fixed on the creature, so I could not see how the digging was progressing. Quite poorly, I feared. That being said, my job was to gain as much time as possible and keep the monster distracted. With that in mind, I stood there staring at it while it stared right back. I saw Julie, thoroughly ignored, creep closer to her position. She, the mammoth, and I were now at an obtuse angle with about 50 meters between each in that order. Behind me was the pit wall, perhaps to stop the prey from escaping.

As I stood there contemplating my next move, the furball took action. Ever so slowly, it raised its massive legs and took a step forward. One could be forgiven for thinking that a being of this size was moving at a suitably low speed. I wasn't fooled, however, as I knew of the bursts a rush Skill could cause. Without another thought, I took a step back. The monster would take one step towards me, I'd take a couple of steps back in sync. So it went on for several seconds. Until my back finally touched the solid wall.

I noticed Julie gesturing something to me. 'Stop? Stay here? Can't she see I'm about to become mincemeat?' I almost shook my head. But then I realized that she was rapidly moving towards the blind side of the mammoth. 'Ah, she aims to lure it herself!' I took a step away from the wall, raised my palm, and waited for the thing to come into my range.

Thankfully, my range was longer than its Skill, for I was able to select it before it rushed me. I again chose the same eye as before, now selecting it directly instead of through the eyelids. I whispered four Incendios. The new spell chain seemingly did the trick, it closed its red eye with a pained grunt. I could see a trickle of orange fluid that must've been its blood flow down. That didn't stop its progress, however.

The beast was about 15 meters away from me now. 'Come on Julie, shoot fast!' I prayed. I saw her taking aim from the side.

13 meters. The creature suddenly stopped in its tracks. For a moment, the very air was stilled. The fur on its body bristled as it bent its hind legs a little. Out from the left, I heard Julies customary *whiz* of an arrow. The arrow struck true, right in its healthy eye. Just as the arrow struck, the quadruped showed off why it was the boss of the arena. With such acceleration that seemingly ignored its massive frame, it rushed at me. Newly blind and howling from the pain, it did not correct its course as I veered far out of its trajectory.

The mammoth thundered towards my previous location as if its tail was on fire. And then it crashed into the wall with resounding cracks. One for the wall, other for its skull. It then slumped down, eyes bleeding freely, with a new orange stream joined from the forehead. Soon, its fur changed from dark brown to bright orange. Then it melted. I stood there utterly mesmerized as what was once a majestic creature was now a rapidly evaporating pool of orange blood. Shortly thereafter, the last vestiges of the creature's existence dissipated, leaving behind a veritable pile of resources. With a slight nudge tt my consciousness, I became aware of my new experience, along with the resulting level up and Class up.

···

"Told ya it was dumb," Carol cackled. I was still in a state of incredulity over the sorry way the boss monster died. "Well, I ain't complaining," I replied with a small smile.

"Are you both okay?" Arya looked at Julie, then me. "I'm good," Julie said. "Me too," I said with a warm smile. 'I thought her cold and distant when we first met, but she's actually quite sweet,' I reminisced. "I ran away long before it came near me. By the way, that was a hell of a shot, Julie. Might've just saved my life there," I praised Julie. It was truly remarkable - while the aim was not much of an issue on a stationary object with her True Shot Skill, the timing of that was impeccable. A moment earlier and the thing would've just retreated. A moment later and it would've missed entirely. "Thanks! I got lucky this time, so don't count on it to keep happening," she said with equal parts of humility and caution, while checking her newest acquisition - a longbow.

We were standing in front of the pile of clothes and weapons left behind. While my current robe wasn't in as dire replacement as my previous one had been, I took it nonetheless. The new one was not the common brown anymore, but a grey version that was both thicker yet lighter somehow. 'And so comfortable! I think I can sleep on the stone floor with this on without issues.' Everyone had graduated from brown clothes to grey ones. We hadn't changed yet, the place was essentially an open barren land walled off from all sides. No opportunities for private cloth swap.

Arya took on her new staff. This one had a bit of design on it - not unlike the patterns on the ring. Besides that, it was the same as before. Carol got another set of daggers; her dagger count now reaching a total of four. Taro threw his broken sword away and took the new one. Divin claimed a set of artistic gloves. They had patterns on them as well along with redundant design. 'Redundant design? Since when can I distinguish between useful patterns and otherwise?'

I immediately opened my full Status Window to check for any changes.

---

'Oh, I am proficient now? Also got extra points on some attributes. Apprentice Robe eh? So equipment can have special effects as well, just like in a game. But still, why do these patterns stand out now and not before? Is this the intangible benefit of a Class upgrade? I should check if Betty knows something...'

"What is it?" Divin asked.

"What?" I blinked back.

"You were looking as if something bit ya," Carol supplied helpfully.

"We were talking about the new Skills and extra points we've got. You zoned out there for a while. Got something good?" Taro said, slightly excited.

'Ah, I totally missed the conversation.' "Oh, sorry. There seems to be some effect of Class upgrade that I can't figure out," I apologized. I removed the ring I acquired in the last upgrade and showed it to Betty, pointing at the seemingly innocuous designs on it. "What does this pattern mean, do you know?"

"Why yes! It is a Rune. Spells can be etched onto suitable surfaces that can be cast by expending mana points. Such spells are called Runes. While there are a variety of Runes, ranging from the complexity of arrangement to usage restriction all of them come under the Runic category of general spell etching," Betty replied with emotionless cheer. Perhaps she was looking forward to this question for a while.

"What do the Rune on the ring mean?" I asked back. I noticed everyone else was paying rapt attention to our conversation.

"I'm afraid I cannot say," Betty, back to her cheerless voice.

"So how do I etch a Rune?" I insisted. By now, we knew that while the bot wouldn't outright refuse to answer a question, there were some she preferred over others. If asked about anything unrelated to this world, she moved away from the interlocutor to signify her disinterest. If asked something related to the system and lore of this world, however, she was unusually forthcoming - mostly.

"Etching a Rune is not dissimilar to casting a spell," she replied as if expecting me to understand.

I did not ask anything else, instead trying to internalize the new information. 'So etched spells are just like compiled binaries. Instead of writing the function and calling it, you compile the source and install it on an physical object. Interesting! I wonder if I can reverse engineer it with Identify.' With that thought, I held the ring in my palm and selected it. "Identify," I spoke out loud and a new window opened up.

---

### Apprentice Healer Ring

*Special Effects*

* Augment Attunement - You get a minor amplification to the healing rate of others

---

'Why didn't I try this before?' This ring's effects were useless to me. I thought of giving it to Arya later on. 'That being said, it doesn't help me one bit in understanding Runes. Maybe I'm going about it wrong?'

"We should head out," I heard Julie call out. I moved accordingly, but my mind was still stuck on the issue. 'What am I missing? Ah!' A sudden inspiration struck me. I again help the ring in my hand as I was walking behind others towards the exit. This time, I selected only the pattern that stood out. "Identify," I intoned softly.

---

x617474756e656d656e74 = x617474756e656d656e742b310a

---

'Okaaay... Gibberish. Could be a condensed hex dump. I doubt I can get anything from this.' I sighed and closed the window. I was slightly disappointed. Unknowingly, I had harbored high hopes from the experiment.

'Oh, we are halfway done with the tutorial already!' "Betty, how long have we been here?" I asked. "It has been 13 days 2 hours and 1 minute since you all arrived at Spawn Point." 'Not bad.'

"We've made good progress," Taro extolled from ahead. 'Not that we have anything to compare to, but it could've much worse,' I thought. "I agree," I concurred.

I was still lost in thoughts on Runes and hex dumps when we came upon the exit and made our way out.


## Chapter 21 - Abaia Swamps

"Well, this is new," I heard Carol muse. It was new alright. Level 10 of the Tutorial Dungeon was unlike any other level before. While it was still the dusky sky above and pleasant temperature about, the area before us was unlike anything we've seen before.

So far, we'd encountered barren lands, decrepit ruins, hills and plains, variety of fauna ranging from fresh shrubs to withered oaks. All of them were, however, solid land. The sight I beheld was similar to a serene ocean, filled with inky black waters. I would've mistaken it for scorched earth had I not noticed minor ripples disturb the smoothness every now and then.

Taro picked up a pebble lying near the entrance and threw it into the water. I immediately had flashbacks of a tentacle monstrosity from a certain movie rising up in a similar situation. No appendages moved, yet I heard Betty announce something from the back - "This is level 10 of the Tutorial, The Abaia Swamps!"

···

"Looks like we're on some sort of a beach," Arya quipped.

"Looks like. How are we getting across though?" I asked.

No one spoke for a while. The answer was obvious - we walk through. We didn't know how deep the swamps were, however, nor what sort of creatures habited them.

"First, we go fishing," Divin said with a smile.

"Yep, the Abaia already noticed us after the pebble, now it's our turn to see what they are and how to kill them," Julie seconded.

'Wow, Julie has gone to the dark side!' I thought. Then again, I was thinking similarly. "Let me Identify them first," I said, as I walked ahead to the edge. Flanked by Taro & Divin and backed by the girls, I stood there with my palm outstretched, hoping for a selection. I moved my hand in a random direction over the waters and kept getting a selection after another in quick succession. As if under the serene surface, there was a swarming nest of creatures. Many of them were stationary though, as if in hibernation. I quickly selected one, then another, and then another. All of them said the same -

---

### Infant Abaia - Level 2

*Special Effects*

* Transient Life: You are a temporary variable in a short-lived calculation.

*Skills*

* Short Circuit: Stun both predators and prey with your electric discharges.

---

Oh the same creature that I had identified last, I threw an Incendio. It immediately moved, causing a disturbance in the small area around it. One of its neighbors came up to the surface for a bit, long enough for me to get a good look at its outline.

···

"Eels, aren't they?" (Arya)

"Yep, I clearly saw it. About a meter long, like a snake. And it has got an electrical attack?" (Julie, turning to me)

"Yeah, although I can't say for sure if it's ranged or not." (I replied, thinking about possible lighting spells I could glean)

"Killing them is not much of an issue. The problem is their number, and the fact that we have to wade through them to reach the exit." (Divin, stated matter-of-factly)

"I can clear a path using Incendio temporarily. The problem is that the moment the spell lifts, they will swarm us. Need to check how long the effect lasts and if we can pace ourselves through." (Me)

"Yes, you clear an area, we will cover you from the sides." (Taro, with nods from others)

I cast incendio once and checked how long it took for the eels to gather around against my mana regeneration speed. The plan was that if I could recover my MP before the eels gathered, we could simply cross by chaining Incendios. Unfortunately, it was not to be. The eels came back faster and I had just recovered over half of the cost of incendio. Petrificus mostly slowed them to a degree but not much. The spells apparently didn't work so well underwater. I mentioned the same to the group.

"Hah... it's time to grind our levels then!" (Taro)

And so we did, edging along the coast. I'd cast multiple Petrificus over an area while the rest went wild on the eels. One time, Carol stabbed an eel that had jumped out - it turned into the same inky black water it had jumped from. Another time, Taro drifted out of the petrified area and ran afoul of a bunch of the critters that co-ordinated together to give a sustained electrical shock. Thankfully, he fell back into cold waters away from them.

One eel did not give out much of XP, between 10 to 20. However, rarely did we find a single eel on its own. They were always bunched up in groups of anywhere between five and fifty. Even Julie, who was using her arrow as a mini-spear, would hit multiple in a single thrust. I bet it wouldn't have been so easy if they weren't spell-cooled.

As I was resting on the sands recovering my mana and watching the slaughter, I felt an instinctual tug of level up. I opened up my Status to check the gains :

I had a minor insight on why the attributes did not linearly correspond to stat points. It was because they also had a hand in the regeneration of said stats. So whenever I had an increase in stat point, as I did now in HP, there would be a corresponding decrease in regeneration speed. This meant my mana regeneration was higher this time around. 'Lucky!'

Unfortunately, the MP consumed by my spells no longer decreased. Both were stuck at 150 for some reason. Identify was down to 10. While the increase in Mana capacity technically meant I could cast longer chains of a spell, it never worked in practice. After a few casts, the spells no longer affected the target.

Opening up my questlist, I chuckled at my todos -

---

* Increase spell variety
* Check changes from Class upgrade

---

I had a good idea for my next spell. I added it as a sub-quest. And removed the abstract "check changes"; I may have sorta completed it anyway.

---

* Increase spell variety
  * Stun spell using potential difference

---

I glanced at Arya alongside casting self-heal. "Leveled up?" she inquired. "Yep, I'm gonna check if we can move on. Can you watch my back?" I requested. "You got it," she acknowledged.


## Chapter 22 - Stupefy

The journey across the swamps was simple thereafter if tiring nonetheless. I chain-casted Incendios to move the eels out and make way. Thankfully, the route was easy to infer as well, it simply became deep if we went astray. Halfway through, everyone had leveled up. By the time we sighted the bridge, I had leveled up again!

'Guess we can skip levels, eh?' Upon the bridge, I ran my test function again. No dice. 'Perhaps I should rename it. I will be doing lots of testing, can't have everything named test.' The next "test" was for my new lightning spell. I figured that since electricity is simply the transfer of energy via electrons across a path of least resistance from higher potential to lower, I could create two points of potential difference and it should just work.

'Okay, so far, the Status Window has managed to capture my intent. It shouldn't just be the window though - the code I write is my will itself, interpreted by the "core". So if I do this...' Thus, I started my experimentation on a new spell while recovering mana.

---

```sh

createLowPoint l = (while (true) l.potential--)

createHighPoint h = (while (true) h.potential++)

```

---

I used a loop since the voltage required for "sparks" will vary with distance and medium between the two points. It didn't matter if it looked like an infinite loop since I could cancel the spell from my side as well whenever I wanted. 'Okay, here we go.'

I picked up two pebbles lying nearby. Arya, Divin, and Taro looked on expectantly. The other two were resting. "Ne, what are you doing?" Taro enquired. Before I could answer, Arya interjected - "He's probably trying a new spell, right?" "Right on" I smiled. Juxtaposing the pebbles about 2 centimeters apart, I cast my spells in quick succession. Selecting pebble on the right: "createLowPoint", then in the same breath on the left one: "createHighPoint"; that done, I kept an eye on the stats.

Both consumed 10 mana points as they started. Every other second, the consumption increased by 2-3 points until it reached 20 per second when there was suddenly a small "crack", not unlike a static shock. I canceled the ongoing spells. "You're making lightning?" Divin questioned. "Hell yeah! Can you make it fall from the sky as well? That would be EPIC!" Taro was more excited than I was by the success. "Nice work. You got fire and air down. If you get water, earth and heart as well, we'd have our own Captain Planet!' Arya quipped. I looked at her with a deadpan face. 'What an old ass joke, who would even get that? Oh wait, I did. Damn.' "Who's Captain Planet?" Taro asked. No one answered. I shook my head and contemplated making the spell more efficient and deadlier than the playful pinch it was now. 'Perhaps use partial surfaces and multiple points? Also, I should combine these into a parent function; I have a perfect name for it...'

···

The later levels' monsters were not worth mentioning. The terrain itself was quite varied though.

We had waist-high scorpion-type monsters in a desert region on level 11. Thankfully, they weren't poisonous.

On level 12, we had a Tundra-themed area with packs of dire wolves.

Level 13 had us battling in a valley against griffons. This time, they were even named so.

We were resting on the bridge. All of us were level 14. The creatures had started bleeding since level 11, albeit not the exact color of human blood but close enough. Our equipment, once again, was in dire straits. Carol was down to one dagger. Julie lost a lot of arrows in the valley, now down to just 10 or so. Divin's sword had its endpoint missing. Fortunately, our clothes, while dirty, took abuse like champs. A good wash and they would be good as new.

I was quite looking forward to the next Class Upgrade. The first one increased the effects of my Perception, allowing me to select small or large areas of anything in range. The latter gave me the ability of Runes. I had yet to fully explore that one. For now, I can only distinguish between patterns as spells or not. I did try to experiment with it on the bridges, but I couldn't for the life of me create any Runes. I tried copying the exact pattern on the ring, Arya's staff, and Divin's gloves into the dirt, but no success. Oh, Divin's gloves were shredded too, griffon claws are no joke. Thinking of possible gains with the next level, I hoped it was something Rune-related. Just imagining the extent of applications made my mouth drool.

None of us talked of home again beyond passing mentions of similarities. For better or worse, we were highly focused on finishing the Tutorial. Even conversations with Betty lessened. There wasn't much to ask her about anymore and she wasn't the best conversationalist anyway. I had rested on this bridge instead of experimenting like usual - it would not do to enter a boss fight with anything but the best state.

Soon enough, we got up. No one had to urge anyone or say anything. As if it had become a habit by now, that our actions simply were in sync. Carol took lead, followed closely by Julie. The knights were slightly behind and covering the flanks. Arya and I were in the rear and clumped together. Betty trailed at the end.

The entrance led us to a well-lit area. 'Wait no, is that the Sun??? And what is this warm breeze I feel on my cheeks? Am I in heaven?' Weeks of the dusky sky and temperate air had dulled my senses to a point where I was shocked to a standstill just witnessing this miracle. I simply closed my eyes and let it all wash over me. I was indulgent to the point of losing myself when Arya elbowed my ribs, "Get a hold of yourself, there could be a monster around!" I grunted, thankful and yet not for her reminder, as I took in the surroundings.

We were moving at a slow pace, as we usually did before identifying our opponents. Soon we came upon something halfway between a large hill and a small mountain. It was hollowed out a bit from the top to form a large cavern. Sparse trees and broken stone structures were lying near the base of the same.

If not for this ominous structure, this place would have been perfect for a picnic. No one doubted that the cavern was where our foe lay. I wondered what sort of creature could inhabit such a large cave. And why the sunny ambiance anyway? Soon, the group decided to take cover under the shade of an outermost tree and plan the next steps.

···

"What should we do?" (Carol)

"We have to identify the monster. I bet it's inside that cave. One of us should go and check." (Me)

"I agree. Would you like to go? You have the highest damage and restrictive spells with your temperature control." (Divin looking at me)

"I doubt they would help. They barely affected the last boss. If there's something similar inside, my pathetic health and stamina  means I'll be dead before I could even turn to run. Also, shouldn't front fighters like knights take the lead?" (Me, slightly annoyed for some reason)

"I'll go," (Carol, interrupting any counter to my statement) "But not alone. Nay. I'll take lead and go inside to take a looksie. Ya'll hang around the mouth and come help if I scream."

"Sounds like a plan. Let's go." (Julie, ending the conversation)

...

Pretty soon, we reached the mouth of the huge cavern. Taro, Arya, and I took position by the left side with Julie and Divin went to the right. Carol muffled her footsteps and ventured inside.

After a few tense minutes of nothing happening, we relaxed our guard a bit. I looked at Taro who has started fidgeting.

"What do you think is - " he started but was cut off by a loud deep roar that shook not only the cavern but our very bones. I heard Betty said something but I was in no state to notice.

Everyone stood still, not taking a breath. We looked at each other and came to a similar conclusion. It would be extremely foolish to enter the cave. Whatever was inside, even its fart would be the death of us. Our hesitation lasted for a bit, but when the ground shook with the steps of the creature inside making its way out, we took off for the level entrance without a second thought. Carol... she could take care of herself. She was a scout for a reason. She was the best of us at hiding and running. We all rationalized the situation in our minds.

After a while of sustained sprinting, I looked back and saw Carol running out of the trees. I was at the very end of our group. Running was not my forte; and even with increase stats, I was the slowest and close to winded. I waved at Carol. She didn't wave back. Instead, she screamed at me to run faster. Her eyes were wild. I did not want to know what she saw in that cave; but my eyes were drawn to the entrance anyway. I saw a brownish reptilian head poking out, glaring at Carol as she headed our way. The head was not unlike the Sobeks, but its edges were more pronounced. The head came out, followed by a long neck. The brown color shifted in the sunlight, and I saw that they were scaled. A clawed hand the size of my torso grabbed the cave entrance where I stood not long ago. The monster walked out, huge bat-like wings followed. It let out another terrifying roar that even at this distance made me want to shit myself. Then with a flap of its appendages, it took to the sky.

'Ah... shit!'

## Chapter 23 - Dragon Hunters

"*A LESSER DRAGONLING?*" Carol fumed, "'Tis as big as a damn house, and ye tell me not only it be a wean but a *lesser* one? Aye, we're getting skelping alright."

"Uhm, yes. That's what Betty said." Taro fumbled about looking helpless at her onslaught.

Somehow, we managed to make it back to the entrance. Apparently, the monster of this level was a young dragon of a lesser variant. It had not yet developed fire-breathing related organs nor learned proper flying. Not that it mattered, it could still sneeze in our general direction and we drop dead.

As it were, it was now perched on top of the mountain. Unblinking eyes locked onto the entrance. Seems like it had trouble going far away from its cave since it couldn't just fly in and out. Or perhaps it was just lazy. I was thankful enough for that; it had saved our lives.

According to Carol, she had activated two of her skills before going in - one to muffle footsteps, another to shroud her in darkness and mask her smell. The latter was a new one she got from her last Class Up. After following the only way in, she came upon a large hall-like structure with a small pile of old coins and dusty broken equipment in the center with the creature snoring nearby. She stayed by the foyer taking it all in when her mana ran out. She had miscalculated the drain by keeping two skills active for so long. As soon as it happened, she scrambled back towards us.

As we lingered by the entrance, lost in our thoughts, I noticed the dragon let out a big yawn, showing off sword-like teeth visible even at this distance. It let out a snort and left its perch. With small hops, it leaped down into the cavern entry and vanished inside. I glanced at the others, seeing my determined look reflected in theirs. Time to hunt a dragon.

...

"All right, anyone got any ideas?" (Julie, starting the brainstorming session)

"Head-on attacks are out. I bet we can't even scratch it. And I doubt magical attacks work either." (Arya)

"Nor can we take the risk to find out. Our only option is to attack from a range." (Divin)

"But I'm almost out of arrows. And I don't think they would much help either way. We shouldn't let it out the cave. Inside, its movements are restricted." (Julie)

"But how are we going to keep it inside? Even if we do, how will we damage it?" (Taro, panicking)

'And here I thought you wanted to wrestle with a full-grown dragon atop an active volcano. Heh.' (Me, in my head)

"..." (Everyone, lost in thought again)

"I may have something." (Me)

"What is it? Another trap?" (Julie)

"Well, sort of. I imagine it is still inside the hall, sleeping soundly thinking itself safe and secure from all attacks. Which it is, in a way. So we won't be attacking at all. What if we start a bonfire near the entrance and let the smoke in? Dragon or not, it still needs to breathe." (Me, a little smug)

"Y-You... You want to kill a dragon by suffocating it?" (Taro, bewildered)

"Bwhahahahaha, PEDRO!" (Carol, losing it)

"Asphyxiation. Well, that could work. As for keeping it inside, we could use those stones as blockages. Yes, it could work..." (Divin, apparently visualizing the plan)

"Sometimes, you can be pretty scary, you know?" (Arya, looking at me sideways with a slight smile)

...

Without dallying further, we got to work. The chances of this plan working were quite high - as long as preparations went off without a hitch. That meant the dragon had to wake up only when it was choking to death. Any earlier and all efforts go down the drain, along with our element of surprise.

Felling the trees was quite efficient with sharpened wind strikes of Taro's swings. Divin helped cut the logs into manageable pieces, which Carol piled into the cave somewhere. She had found a perfect place to light the fire, such that smoke would blow inwards naturally and clog the hall. Julie and I were carrying large stone blocks to the entrance. Normally, it would have been impossible for us to even budge these huge half-ton blocks. However, I retried the elevation spell on them, as a curse. While it did not lift them, it gave us a small window where we could push it ahead bereft of any weight. Arya ferried the logs between Divin and Carol. Carol would also sneak in from time to time to check on the napping reptile.

We worked tirelessly. I wiped out my SP more often than not, requiring frequent breaks. Finally, after however many hours, our setup was complete. The dragon hadn't noticed us at all. Out "blootered" according to Carol.

I held a dry branch in my hand, not unlike a torch. We were standing outside our stone barricade. I watched others gather around me, jaws set in grim determinations. Taking in a deep breath, I selected the top part of the branch and cast Incendios on it. Soon enough, it was set aflame. I handed the makeshift torch to Carol, who promptly disappeared into a manhole-sized tunnel at the edge of our barricade. Minutes ticked by as we waited. Eventually, a head of disheveled curly reds poked out the tunnel and we marched back to the level entrance in silence.

I wasn't sure what to expect. After the bone-chilling roars, I half expected the dragon to swoop in while I was shifting the rocks. Later, I envisioned it exploding out of our hasty barrier closing on us like a giant iron maiden. Yet, nothing happened. Apparently, the stories about the pride of dragons weren't without merit. Or was it because of the stories that it was so? Either way, it was done now. In fact, this was the best-case scenario. All we had to do was wait.

...

We did not have to wait for long. I felt the familiar pull of Class Up in my mind. 'So the dragon is dead. Did not even reach the barrier. Looks like it died in its sleep.'

I was about to open my Status Window to check my gains when I halted my finger mid-air. Something felt... off. Different somehow. So far, I was able to select any object by pointing my palm straight at now. It didn't feel like I had to do that now. No, I could actually select multiple objects simultaneously - anywhere between five to ten, depending on factors like size and distance. Without pointing my palm at any one in particular. With a hunch, I lifted my other hand. While the area of effect stayed the same, I realized I could select at least three times as more objects. 'Holy Shit! Looks like I got another Perception related upgrade. An uber-powerful one at that'

Deciding to experiment with it later, I opened my Status Window.

'Hmm, my mana is totally off the charts. Still not enough for the test though. Did I rename that function? I should do it soon. Health is... okay I guess. Stamina is pathetic as always. Not much else to see. I bet others are salivating over new skills!' Slightly peeved, I opened up my repo. Renamed test to hackPass, added the long-overdue incendio curse and moved questlist out of sight below so it doesn't interfere with my view of code. Also added a few items to it, making it a proper list of quests. 'Yeah, that should do it.'

---

```sh

incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)

petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = x.temperature / 2)

identify o = (echo o)

hackPass = (i = 0; while (i <= 255) (str = getChar[i++]; echo "$str $(getTime)" >> file; echo $str | sudo -S echo $str "worked!" ))

getChar i = awk 'BEGIN{printf "%c", i}'

getTime = date +%s%N

petrificus_slowly x = (while (true) x.temperature--)

incendio_slowly x = (while (true) x.temperature++)

createLowPoint l = (while (true) l.potential--)

createHighPoint h = (while (true) h.potential++)

```
