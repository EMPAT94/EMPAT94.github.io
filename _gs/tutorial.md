# Volume 1 - Tutorial

## Prologue

I opened my eyes to a dark sky. 'Not a cloud in sight, must be late at night. Oh, no stars even in this dark, interesting...' I thought; 'Wait... Why am I looking for stars? Where the hell am I?'. There was diffused lighting about, the kind you would get on a late sunny evening, but I couldn't pinpoint a source. My wandering hands found hold of dry grass beside my prone body. Now I was worried. I quickly got up and looked around. Some sort of plain landscape surrounded by what looked to be high cliffs on all sides but one. There were some people gathered there, so that was where I made my way.

As I sauntered over to the group, I saw a figure floating in the air. I did a quick double-take. 'What the hell!?!' There was a woman in Egyptian-esque costume floating off the ground, her eyes closed. Surrounded by 5 more people. Thankfully, the people were quite grounded - and looked as confusing as I felt. From the looks of it, they had gathered quite recently as well. Just as I was about to ask what the f+ck was going on, the floating woman opened her eyes, looked over us all as if making sure we were paying attention, then exclaimed -

"Welcome, to the Grand Simulation!"

The Cleopatra look-alike continued after a slight pause, "Congratulations! You all have been chosen as test subjects for acceptance testing of Grand Simulation v389.12.425. My name is Betty, and I am here to answer any and all the questions you have. Please ask away!"

One of the people standing about, a tall wiry-thin blonde woman, quickly asked: "Where the f+ck am I?" - well, you took the words right out of my mouth there sister. Betty looked at the woman and answered without missing a beat, "You are currently in the Spawn Point for test subjects. The Spawn Point is located inside the Tutorial Dungeon. The Tutorial Dungeon is located in the memory region of the Simulation itself; it is, however, removed from the space and time constraints of the main program!"

The blonde had her mouth hanging open. I noticed that after I managed to gather my own slack jaws. Before anyone else could ask anything else, I spoke up - "How do we get back home?". Betty's eyes, which were trained on the blonde so far, now bore into me. They seemed devoid of life for some reason. She spoke in her eerie voice again "To get out of the Tutorial, and the Simulation as a whole, you must be deleted; in other words, you must die." Not only did our mouths hang open again like a sinkhole, I felt several hearts skip a beat, or perhaps just mine skipping more than once. We all looked at each other, but no one spoke for a while.

"Anoo... How are you flying?" a black-haired youth on my left asked. He had been gawking at Betty for a while. 'Quite the silver-lining kind of guy we have here; also she is not flying, just floating' I argued uselessly in my mind. Betty turned to him in her mechanical manner - I was glad she wasn't staring at me anymore and answered: "It is a spell that inverses gravity until the mass of my body is balanced off by the pull in either direction at an elevation of 2.73 meters off the ground". While that was a lot to chew on, I immediately caught on something - 'float SPELL?'. Apparently, the silver-lining kid did as well - he was practically shaking with excitement. "*You can do magic?*", he asked her. She replied again - perhaps it was only me, but it looked like she was expecting this question, "Why yes! Everyone in the Simulation can cast spells and do magic. Even you! Some classes are restricted to only using said spells while other classes can actively tweak other spells or create new ones entirely!". 'Classes? Magic? What...?'

"Ummm... Is there any other way of getting out of this... Simulation. Besides, you know, dying?" a fair doe-eyed girl asked from beside the blonde. "I'm afraid there isn't", Betty replied and continued eyeing the poor girl as if mocking her. While everyone digested that, I put in another question, "What are we supposed to do here?". To which Betty replied after setting her glare on me, "First, you must complete the Tutorial to get to the base level of human adults in the Simulation; once you finish the Tutorial and enter the Simulation, you are free to do as you wish".

···

Betty wasn't going anywhere soon; the blonde had confirmed that with her. So here we were, introducing ourselves at blondie's insistence; she went first -

"You all can call me Julie. I'm a lawyer, and I live in Berlin" she said and looking around for whoever was going next. Another plump looking girl with a reddish hair-do by her side coughed slightly to get everyone's attention.

I suddenly noticed that there were three women, all on my right, grouped up. And two guys standing some distance apart to my left. The Japanese kid and another slightly overweight guy. Everyone was either around my age of mid-20s or younger than me. The girl continued her introduction since no one interrupted -

"I'm Carol, Irish. I am studying Uni". With that, she did a slight nod of her head and stepped back. If not for the current situations, I could see her being the life of a party, or being mischievous in general. No one spoke up next, so I did.

"Name's Pat, I'm a Programmer". I said my piece and stayed silent. No point in wasting too many words. The Japanese guy went next.

"Hajimemashta, my name is Taro. I am 17 years old, a high school student from Japan" he said and looked around with a carefree smile as if he knew some secret no one else did. What I'd give to know where his cheery attitude came from!

"Divin's the name, I am from Congo. I own a small business" said the guy in a deep voice. The only remaining girl had the attention of us all; she didn't seem too keen on talking but spoke nonetheless -

"I am Arya", she said simply. 'To the point, are we?'

'Good, now that's done, back to getting the hell out of doge' I thought. Apparently, so did everyone else, as we all turned back to Betty for an in-depth interrogation session. 'Please let this just be some weird dream' I prayed. If only I knew the kind of sh+t I was going to end up in, I might have prayed harder, a lot harder...

## Chapter 1 - Chat Bot

"Why are we here?" (Julie)

"You all are test subjects for -" (Betty)

"No, I mean, why are *WE* here? Why us?" (Julie)

"Oh, you were randomly sampled from your planet with uniform distribution of gender and location. Also, your ability to speak, read and write the common language with certain fluency favored your selection to a degree" (Betty)

"..."

"Can't you just send us back?" (Carol, looking a bit hopeful)

"I'm afraid I cannot send you back" (Betty)

"How do I do magic?" (Taro, still excited)

"First, you must select a Class. There are 6 base Classes that anyone can choose from, although you may choose only one; all Classes have the ability to cast magic. However, only Healer and Mage Classes can create spells on their own. Other Classes rely on their Skills to intuitively cast magic." (Betty)

"Sweet, how do I get a Class?"  (Taro)

"To get a - " (Betty)

"Wait, hold on. What the hell is this? Just how are we here? Am I dreaming or something? Why can't you send us back home? You basically kidnapped us and are now forcing us to do whatever. I want to go home!" (Me, slightly losing it)

"This is the Tutorial Dungeon. You are not dreaming. You can leave the Simulation by deleting yourself" (Betty)

"OK, so how did you bring us here? I don't remember being nabbed or anything" (Me)

"I did not bring you here, I am here just to answer your questions" (Betty)

"So... *How* exactly did we end up here?" (Arya, backing me up)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Why not?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Yeah I know, you just said that. I'm asking why not?" (Me, exasperated)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"..."

"She's a dammed chatbot! Just great! Stuck inside a simulation with a bunch of strangers and a smart-ass bot." (Me, mostly to myself but came out loud)

"You're a chatbot, aren't you?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot - " (Betty)

"Of course you cannot..." (Me, grumbling to myself again)

"Ano... How do I get a Class again?" (Taro, looking at me as if asking me to shut up)

"To get a Class, you must open up your Status Window. You can open your Status Window by swiping up with a finger. Before you select a Class, I recommend going through the descriptions to get one most suited to yourself, as you will be stuck with that Class and its evolution tree for the rest of Simulation" (Betty)

Everyone swiped their finger in the air and got a glazed look in their eyes. I did as well, and a virtual reality type window opened up. It was empty save for two things - a "Select Class" red glowing text and a tiny tilde ~ symbol at the bottom right. I was about to click on "Select Class" when I heard Divin, who had been silent so far, speak up.

"Why are you dressed like that?" (Divin, deadpanned)

"This Simulation and everything in it has been constructed with inspiration taken from your planet's stories from the ages, be they history or fantasy. As for this particular attire, it was meant to stand out so I could attract your attention when you spawn here" (Betty)

"Is that so..." (Divin, quieting down)

Now dragged out of our concentration from admiring the Status Windows, another barrage of questions was fired at Betty.

"What about our necessities? Like food, water, etc?" (Julie)

"You do not need sustenance in the Tutorial Dungeon. This place is outside of the main program and not subject to the same space and time constraints; as such you are exempt from hunger, thirst, and sleep for the duration of your stay. You will, however, get injured or fatigued as you expend health or stamina points, and will require treatment or rest to reclaim it" (Betty)

"So we just... Finish this tutorial and get out of here? All on our own?" (Arya)

"This Tutorial aims to bring you to the baseline of an adult human in the Simulation. You may act alone, or in groups. I will, however, follow along until you have completed the Tutorial Dungeon to answer any and all questions you have. Please ask away!" (Betty)

No one asked anything. Apparently, Betty was going to stick around, or rather float around, for quite a while. We all went back to our Status Windows to read the Class Descriptions.

## Chapter 2 - Class Selection

I clicked on Select Class text. Nothing happened. My hand went through the window. I looked at the interface for a while. I tried clicking the tilde symbol. Same nothing. I looked about and saw others going through similar ordeals. Eventually, Taro whined impatiently at Betty "Nothing is happening, my finger goes through it! How do I click on this?" Betty immediately answered, "Physical interaction with the Status Window was phased out 254 major versions ago, to 'click' on an item, simply focus on the same. While a bit unwieldy at first, stats show that such interaction is 28 times more efficient than the previous medium."

I focused on the text, and immediately the screen was replaced by a bunch of sections - six, to be precise. I slowly scrolled through each section, reading the brief description of each.

---

KNIGHT - Base Class

Sword-wielding swashbuckler, adept at mêlée combat; very high strength attribute with the ability to use quick skills in addition to the sword and keep up a good defense at the same time.

SCOUT - Base Class

With high agility and stealth attributes, scouts generally prepare for the arrival of the main party - be it by securing the route ahead or scoping out the enemy camp for potential incursion points.

HEALER - Base Class

With a good leg up on intelligence and endurance attributes, healers take care of their health, and that of others, by topping it off with pre-defined skills or customized spells.

CRAFTSMAN - Base Class

Low but well-rounded attributes, get an extra utility skill on each Class upgrade. Create or modify items, enchantments, and structures from scratch with the right materials and skills.

ARCHER - Base Class

Focusing on dexterity and agility, this long ranger either distracts an opponent so the party can get close or goes in for the killer shot on a distracted one, adapting to the situation as required.

MAGE - Base Class

Very high intelligence at the cost of other attributes. Instead of getting a pre-defined skill when leveling up, craft highly specialized and equally deadly personal spells.

---

Ha... My Class was set a while ago when Betty mentioned them for the first time. I focused on selecting that class and the window went back to the main screen describing my Class and current Status

I was feeling quite good about myself. I looked around to see that others were still absorbed in their screens. I waited a minute, then another. After 5 min, I was quite sure something was amiss. I asked Betty about the tutorial to while away time. According to her, there were 20 levels going down until the 'Exit Portal' at the bottom. We were currently on level 0. You couldn't enter a higher level unless you were at that level or higher. She mentioned that the tutorial was tailored to get us to level 20, which was the baseline of adult humans in this (well, the outer simulated) world. She wouldn't go in-depth about the environment of each level and other details, so I figured it was more 'explore-and-see' kind of thing the creators were going for. She wouldn't answer who the creators were, what or who the test was by, and for, or absolutely anything that had nothing to do with the Simulation itself. I tried several different variations but her lips were sealed tight.

This back and forth went on for another 15 minutes I reckon, when people started coming to. I looked around to hear what each had chosen. Hopefully, not everyone had chosen the Mage class.

···

"Man, the Mage class is so nerfed! And here I was, foolishly looking forward to it." Taro exclaimed. 'Wait... What?'

"Yeah", Carol agreed, "When I looked at the detailed description and attribute distribution, it was even below the Craftsman class. Anyway, I chose the Scout. What about you two?" 'Heh?'

"I chose Knight", he said - as if it should have been obvious, and looked at me expectantly.

"Ummm, what do you mean when you say the Mage class is nerfed? And what's this about attribute distribution?" I asked them instead. To which Taro replied, "Well if you focused on getting detailed info about a certain Class, you could see in-depth information about their capabilities, roles, and growth potentials. I say Mage is nerfed because that class does not get any skills as other classes do. They have to create spells on their own to use magic. Why would anyone want to do research here?", with a pause, he continued, "Also, all the attributes were lowest I could see compared to others - even craftsmen had a good 3 on most, except for intelligence. What's the point of starting with lots of mana when you can't even use it, right? And I don't even know how one would go about building customized spells - sounds like a lot of work to me." Taro concluded. All I could think of was - 'Well... sh+t'

Carol chimed in, "Yeah, I even got 3 special effects for my class. I believe Mage had only one. What skills did you get for the Knight, Taro...". The conversation continued; eventually, the rest of the girls joined in. Arya took the Healer class, Julie the Archer. Finally, Divin joined in too. Apparently, he had taken the Knight class as well. There was a bit of hubbub over there not being any Craftsman, but I was too engaged in cursing my own stupidity and impatience to notice much of what was being said at the moment.

···

After a while, I told them that I had taken the Mage class. Thankfully, all I got were a few confused looks. It seems that the attributes were also dependent on the class. As such, the Knight class had a 'Vigor' attribute that resulted in extra HP regeneration, while the Scout had 'Stealth' attribute - I had neither. Arya had an 'Attunement' that affected the rate of healing applied to others. I realized I had no clue what effects attributes had, so I excused myself and took another look at the Status Window, this time willing it to show me attribute description.

---

| Attribute    | Affects                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physical attack damage dealt and received |
| Vitality     | Health Points                             |
| Agility      | Movement Speed                            |
| Dexterity    | Movement Range                            |
| Intelligence | Mana Points                               |
| Perception   | Magical attack range                      |
| Wisdom       | Magical attack defense |

---

I see. I have no special health regeneration; and every monster and their mother would notice me without the stealth attribute. Others also had a 'skills' section below special effects with one skill each already. While I was reading the attribute description, Carol was trying out a skill to silent her footsteps. With magic. And here I was - a Mage, twiddling my thumbs. Yeah, I was pretty pissed off at myself.

## Chapter 3 - Level 0

A dream is only a dream after you wake up. While you are dreaming, it becomes your reality. I believe all of us here had taken being kidnapped quite well, considering everything. At least no one broke down. I could tell Carol was putting up a brave front. Taro was actively enjoying it. Julie was still on the fence about whether to laugh or cry, but she was distracting herself by taking charge. Arya was silently sulking. I couldn't get a read on Divin though. As for me? I was wondering what my folks at home would be up to, they must've lost it by now. I decided to ask the Betty about it, not expecting an answer, "Hey, what about the people back on our planet, surely they would've noticed us missing?" Surprisingly, I got a response. "The Simulation is not subject to the space-time constraints of your world; just like the Tutorial is separate from the Simulation, the Simulation is separate from your reality." 'Ah, makes sense. It is like time has stopped there, eh?'

We gathered around Betty, ready to go where fate would lead us. Julie was just about to say something when Betty spoke up again - "So, you have all got your Classes, allow me to lend your starting equipment!" So saying, she raised her hand and down came a stream of light in front of each of us. Two swords in front of Taro and Divin, a bow and quiver full of arrows in front of Julie, a dagger for Carol and staff for Arya. I got nothing. "Ummm, my equipment seems to be missing?" I queried. "Mages don't need a physical weapon to attack", she said. 'What, are you kidding me?'. "At least, give me a dagger or something, just in case!" I begged. "I'm afraid I cannot". I looked around and got only sympathetic looks. I didn't give up though, "But I do not know any magic spells. How am I supposed to defend myself?". "I'd recommend creating a spell", she said. "I didn't really go to Hogwarts, you know. I have absolutely no clue how to go about making or using a spell!" I bit back. "While I do not have the data of how you should create your spell, I am certain you must use your Status Window to create one. For reference, allow me to upload my floating spell into your repository..."

I opened up my Status Window again and immediately noticed that the tilde (~) symbol at the bottom was bold. I focused on it and a terminal-like screen opened up. It was blank save for one line:

`float o = (while (o.elevation < 2.73) _____.gravity--)`

I was dumbstruck. 'Sh+t...It's a god damned program. True, it looks like an unholy union of Haskell and Javascript, with bits of Lisp and redacted code in between; but I recognize it nonetheless. And I actually have a shell to work on? F+cking A!' I almost did a small victory dance but contained myself hastily. My smile must have betrayed me, however, as Arya had a weird look in her eyes.

"Perhaps we should get going now?" Julie broke the awkward silence and looked at Betty. Betty didn't move a muscle. Seems like she meant it literally when she said she will be *following* us. Another moment later, Julie huffed a bit, shouldered her bow and arrows, and lead the way out of the Spawn Point clearing. Just as we stepped out of the choke point leading out onto a wide road, Betty turned from Cleopatra to Will-'O-the-Wisp. It was Carol who spoke up, "Why'd ya turn into a ball of light?" to which Betty replied, "It is easier to split into multiple entities in this form, and it is also lighter on resource consumption" 'Ah, she did say she would follow us all even after we went individually. So this is how. Weird, but logical.' Apparently, Carol thought so too, because she didn't have any follow-up questions.

···

The unremarkable road eventually lead us to an unremarkable field. It was big enough to fit a couple of football stadiums. Albeit barren of any fauna, it was sprouting something oozy in large quantities. Wait, are these slimes? "What is this?" Julie enquired, motioning in the general direction of the slimes. Betty-the-wisp spoke up, "This is Level 0 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Slime Field" 'Clever naming sense there' "The entrance to Level 1 is on the opposite side of our current position; you must cross this field and reach level 1 before you can proceed further"

I looked around the field. If was filled with slimes of all sizes and colors. The one thing they all had in common was how lazily they were ambling towards nowhere in particular. I was quite absorbed in taking in the view, so I missed the moment when Taro and Julie made their move. Taro moved ahead, sword held up in both hands in front of him, while Julie took out her bow and notched an arrow. This was when I noticed their actions and thought to myself 'We should have made a plan first. Even a signal would've been appreciated'.

Julie let loose the arrow, which zoomed in quite rapidly towards a particularly large green slime ball. I was impressed - until it harmlessly hit the ground. Taro wasn't faring any better. He tried slashing his sword into a smaller blue slime, but the creature brushed it off and bounced back. The attack had caused a commotion and three more slimes were headed to Taro's location. Another arrow, another slash - no effect. The slimes were gathering. Carol had joined in at some point, covering Taro's flank. Divin, Arya and I were standing a distance away, behind Julie.

The other slimes were now closer and surrounding Taro and Carol. Some others were headed in our direction, probably due to Julie digging up dirt near them with her arrows. Suddenly, a blue slime jumped out of the crowd and slammed into Taro's chest. He fell flat on his butt. Carol came to him and gave her his hand when another yellow slime smashed into her back. Thankfully, she braced herself somehow. Both of them ran back to where we were standing. Julie also stopped shooting. The crowd of slimes was now considerable and headed in our direction like an avalanche. We hightailed it out of there and almost came back to the Spawn Point itself.

···

"Well, that sucked!" Julie started, "I am down to half my arrows" she moaned.

"I tried hitting their core, but they kept slipping in and out of the crowd" Taro continued.

"Perhaps we need a plan?" Carol chimed in.

"Yes. They are attracted to arrows, which we can use to draw one in; isolate it from others and destroy its core." Divin suggested. 'So, you noticed as well, eh? Nice plan though'

This back and forth continued while I realized there wasn't anything I could contribute. 'No, can't keep things like this. Need to create a spell somehow.' I again excused myself, letting them know of my intentions and headed further back to the center of the Spawn Point.

While I hyped myself up, I couldn't change the fact that I had no clue what to do. A splinter of Betty followed me, the original staying with the rest. I opened up my Status Window and focused on the tilde symbol. The terminal opened up and I gave it a closer look.

Focus with an intent - this was how I concluded the interaction worked. So I focused on the window, willing it to write down the words in my head. Wait, what spell do I want? Let's go with the most generic one.

`fireball =`

Holy Sh+t! Is this awesome or what? Editing with literal thoughts. These guys have achieved *perfection* itself!

It took me a minute to wrap my head around this, but eventually, I calmed down. I looked at the float spell again. It took an argument of 'o'. 'Perhaps I could give a target to the fireball with an argument? How do I actually throw a ball of fire anyway? Wish there was a manual page I could refer to - man, do I miss the internet! Oh wait, I have a literal AI chatbot by my side. Let's see if I can scrape something out of her. It is only a matter of asking the right questions!'

"Hey Betty, do you know how I can create a fireball spell?" I asked a straight question, not expecting an answer. I wasn't disappointed. "I'm afraid I do not", she said. "So, how do I interact with the environment?" I continued. "You must use the environment variables", she replied. For a moment I thought she was having a laugh. She wasn't. 'OK good, got something' "How do I list the environment variables?" I asked. "I'm afraid I cannot answer that". 'Hmm... Would've been nice if you could' I decided to change the phrasing slightly, "How do I *use* the environment variables?". "You can modify the environment variables in your spell by focusing your intent inside the Status Window". 'Damn, no luck. Wait, how did she pass an argument to her float spell?' like a light bulb went off in my head, I was almost giddy when I asked her "Can you show me how you cast the float spell?" In retrospect, this should have been my first question, but I wasn't going to demean myself. While I was wondering about my shortcomings, she changed from her wisp form back to Cleopatra. I leveled a hard stare, not willing to miss a single twitch or whisper out of her. And then, she cast the float spell.

## Chapter 4 - Gesture Input

Betty took a few steps away from me. Raise her hands with palms towards her torso, then spoke in a clear voice - 'float'. As she rose from the ground, it seemed as if cobwebs were clearing in my mind. I gaped at her as she stabilized herself, but my thoughts were far away.

'Is this how a spell is cast then? You choose your target with your hands as an argument, then call the function - err spell, by name... She passed her own body as the argument, and now she is floating!'

I quickly opened my Status Window and got into the terminal. I erased the float spell with a thought. With another, I modified my fireball spell.

`fireball x = x.`

Well, I still didn't know how to call fire. I could choose any target into x and ignite it. 'Hmm... Environment variables she says? How about I just raise the temperature of the target to make it seem like it is on fire? Yeah, that could work' After another quick edit,

`fireball x = (x.temperature++)`

'Wait, increasing temperature by a degree would barely make the thing feverish. I need it to BURNNN. How about I double it?'

`fireball x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * 2)`

I was itching to test it on something; so I closed my Status Window. Betty was back in her wisp form already. I looked at the ball of light - what if... No. It would be a tragically funny joke if a powerful Chat Bot went Rambo on me right now. I instead chose a patch of grass about 10 meters away. While the grass was dry, it was thankfully sparse overall. I could fireball it without needing a fire extinguisher. Taking a deep breath, I raised my hand. My palm was pointing towards a clump of a particularly dense patch. I spoke out as serenely as I could - 'fireball'. Nothing happened.

While the test was technically a failure, I did notice one important thing. When I raised my hand to "select" the clump of grass, I could somehow tell that it was too far away. Perhaps my perception was too low? I lowered my hand, now pointing to a blade of grass a couple of meters away. No sooner had I spoken the magic word that the blade seemed to swoon. Its color had also gotten a bit darker. Test Successful! I cast fireball again on the same blade and its color went pitch black. Even in the dark evening-like ambiance, it stood out from its peers. A slight breeze disintegrated it before my eyes.

As I noticed that, another crazy idea popped into my nugget. Why stop at double? Why not square it? Heck, I could call it recursively until my target is vaporized! Man, I don't care what others say, but the Mage class is not nerfed AT ALL. In fact, it is way too overpowered! Who cares about some attributes or special effects when you can simply smite stuff into oblivion? I immediately added a multiplier in my spell and cast it on another unfortunate blade of grass nearby. My expectations of utter destruction were betrayed however, as this time, nothing happened at all. Not even a small change in color. I reopened my Status Window and checked to see if I hadn't made any typos with my mind, but the code looked good. 'Oh wait, what is this?'

I had failed to notice it in my excitement earlier, but my Mana Point was down to 240 from the original 800. Did I just use up 560 points of mana to burn a blade of grass? As for why the last spell didn't work, I simply didn't have enough mana left. Guess Mages ain't so OP after all.

As I was resting to recover my mana - which according to Betty was quicker for Mages, I thought about the spell I just cast. Impressive as it was, it certainly wasn't what I expected. No literal fiery balls were shot around. How would one go about that, I wondered? Not that it mattered much, I now had an actual attack. Misnomer though it was. Hell, why not change it? It didn't take me long to come up with a pretty original and totally not stolen name -

`incendio x = (x.temperature = x.temperature * x.temperature)`

I was quite proud of myself, as I decided to write another function that went the other way, with a similar naming scheme.

`petrificus_totalus x = (x.temperature = ((x.temperature / x.temperature) - 1))`

'Boom! Freeze mofo, all the way down to zero!!!'

While waiting for my mana to top off, I tried to remember all sorts of spells that Harry - err, that I could come up with on my own.

···

After maybe an hour or so, I headed back to where the others were. I spent the entire time testing out my abilities and limitations. In between, I had to wait for my mana to recover. Apparently, it was supposed to be slower than Stamina regen of seconds to minutes but faster than Health regen of hours to days. For a Mage, it inched quite close to Stamina. All according to Betty, of course. I couldn't get my Status Window to show actual values. In fact, I had trimmed it further. Removed all attributes - I could feel their effects anyway, and rearranged the status points. I also added a list of spells I had in my repository.

Yep, I decided to have only two spells for now. Not that I couldn't come up with others, but since I didn't have a way to comment out stuff, it seemed a bit hazardous to have untested lethal contraptions ready to release on a word readily available.

I also learned quite a few things about magic and spell casting. One couldn't directly change the core stats and attributes of a target. Setting HP to zero in one spell would've turned me into the fabled One Spell Man. Too bad. Also, my range was about 2 meters radius, centered around me. Depending on the factors involved, I could either fully cast a spell or not cast it at all. No half measures. I tried freezing a large region of land as an Area of Effect attack. No luck. Good thing though, all spells took the same amount of mana, irrespective of the target, given that they could be affected. A blade of grass, piece of a boulder and a grain of sand - all took 280 MP on Incendio, even though the effects were dramatically different on each.

As I exited the choke point and traveled across the bridge, I eventually sighted my accomplices. A few colored puddles were splashed about as if a painter had upended his paints in frustration. Up ahead, I saw one unlucky slime being whaled on by Taro, Divin, and Carol with their respective blades. Julie was standing back with the bow in one hand and a loose arrow in another, staring intently but with no apparent intention of firing. Wise choice I suppose, given her aim. Arya was standing beside Julie watching the spectacle. She noticed me as I made my way over and waved her hand awkwardly. I stood silently by their side, becoming a part of the audience. "Any luck with the spell?" she asked. "Oh, you have no idea!" I replied with a smirk.

## Chapter 5 - Slime Fest

While seemingly magical, slimes were no better than beasts when it came to intellect. They were attracted by sound (or vibrations, to be precise) and attacked in a variety of ways, usually depending on their size. The golf ball-sized ones tried to trip you by spreading at your feet. Mostly though, they fled confrontation. The slightly larger ones - about the size of basketballs, bounced at you every now and then while fleeting in and out of your range. The larger ones, the size of large dogs and over, simply tried to crush everything in their path. Perhaps consume the target with the intention of suffocating them. We hadn't encountered anything larger than a pony. The most dangerous ones of the bunch were the bouncy balls, their speed and hit were no joke. At least the larger ones were sluggish and smaller ones inconsequential. Thankfully, we hadn't encountered any actual magical slimes. Like fire-wielding ones. Hell, there weren't any acidic or poisonous ones either. All they had was physical attacks. Pure XP grind.

The slimes were also immune to physical damage. Until you hit their "core", that is. Their death transformed them into puddles. No one had yet tried pure magic on them; magical skills though did seem to damage them. Divin had a skill that did freeze damage with a slash of his sword. It was currently the group's trump card to slowing a slime down just enough to allow Taro to pierce its heart. Taro had a skill that sharpened his strikes. Julie laid the bait, Carol ran interference. Surprisingly, Arya was the busiest of all! After our small chat, having recovered her mana, she dived back into the slaughter and spread her hands in front of Taro. A glowing light around his bruised elbow indicated she was healing him.

Just as the healing stopped, Carol pushed the slime in Divin's direction. He froze it with a large swing. Taro took the opportunity to crack the fist-sized core and add a new pinkish puddle to the palette. They all came back, probably to recover their stamina while Julie went on to collect her arrows. I decided to have a go at the next slime.

···

"Damn, how many did you get already?" (Me, admiring the polychrome ground after everyone had gathered around)

"Oh, quite a few. Got some experience points as well!" (Carol, with a slight smile)

"Not enough though. The points are spread among all four of us and one slime doesn't give out that much in the first place." (Julie, with a sigh)

"Four of you...?" (Me, confused)

"Yeah, I don't attack the slimes. I mostly heal others." (Arya, looking ashamed for some reason)

"And yet you have the most experience points of any of us!" (Taro exclaimed)

"Well, as I said, that is simply because I am doing so much healing; all on my own too!" (Arya defended)

"Out of curiosity, how much point have you guys gained?" (Me)

"I've got 36" (Taro) "32 here" (Carol) "29 for me" (Julie) "35" (Divin, after a while)

"..." (Everyone staring at Arya again)

"Oh, fine already. Jeez. I've got 67 now, OK?" (Arya)

"And I'm zero" (Me, in a slightly lower voice, mostly to myself) "Hey, how did you figure out how to heal?" (directed at Arya)

"Oh, it's a skill I have. Named 'Heal', haha" (Arya, chuckling) "I kinda just figured it out"

"Interesting. How much mana does it take?" (Me, slightly sullen about her intuitive knowledge)

"Oh, about 80. I can cast 3 in a row then I need to recover" (Arya)

"I see. Anyway, guys, I was wondering if I can have a go at the next slime first? Wanna try out a couple of spells" (Me, looking around)

"Sure" "OK" "Hmm" (Positive grumbles all about)

···

Betty had merged back into one. Julie was standing at the front, looking for a suitable slime to lure. I was a couple of meters behind her. Taro, Carol, and Divin were spread out behind me. Arya was at the end. Betty's light was visible beyond Arya's head, giving her a divine halo.

Soon enough, Julie released her bowstring. An arrow went and landed beside a smallish slime. Big enough to fit five tennis balls, I suppose. It rolled towards the arrow. As it was about to reach it, Julie let out another one, this one about halfway between the first and us. Another couple of arrows brought the slime within our striking distance. Julie retreated while I and the three behind me took her place.

Mana? Check. I raised my palm to the slime headed for my legs. Target selected? Check. I exhaled out stale air and filled my lungs with fresh oxygen. 'Incendio' - a slight whisper, no more. Perhaps the slime heard me? It stopped moving for a second. It then twitched and seemed to swell to twice its size. And then it popped. Even made a "pop" sound. Its core exposed to the world, still rolling on the ground towards us carried by momentum. The rest of its remains lay steaming on the ground.

I was dumbstruck. The others were no better off. They were looking at the core with mouths agape, shell shocked. I looked at my Status Window to make sure it really was my spell that did the trick. It was. All my mana was gone. Squaring the temperature rarely worked on anything bigger than a cat-sized object and it sucked all 800 points of my mana. Even on a small object, it was a hit and miss. True gamble, to be honest. Yet against the ill-fated slime, it was perfect. 'Whilst immune to physical damage, they are extra vulnerable to magical attacks, huh?' I surmised.

"Um, shouldn't we break the core?" I eventually asked. Carol moved as if in a daze and stabbed it with a dagger. My Status Window showed I had earned 11 experience points. Everyone seemed to wake up from their dreams, with varied expressions on their face.

"Man, what was that? Incendio? OP skill man, how much mana does it take?", Taro was excited beyond words. "It takes all the considerable mana I have. It's not a skill though, more of a spell" I replied, arguing semantics for no reason. "Still, it was awesome!". 'I agree, it was.' "Now we don't have to stab one a billion times to kill it. That is some nice spell" Julie interjected. 'I agree, it is'. "Did you all get experience points from that one as well?" I asked. "Nah, only I got 'em", Carol said, "only 3 though. Since you did the most damage. You gotta contribute to the fight somehow to get some, even if you don't directly hit anything. You get points according to your contribution." she concluded. "So, you guys still have to fight then" I wondered aloud. "Yes", Divin said, "but it is different now. First, we all will take shots at it. Then you pop it. Then one of us finishes it off. Much more efficient". I was of the same mind. That being said, I can't be out of the fight after a single spell - one that may or may not even work. I decided to revert to my temperature double for the time being. If I paced myself properly, I could fight continuously for however long my mana and stamina held. 'Perhaps one spell every couple minutes. Yeah, that would work.'

···

With that, we all went on a rampage. While Incendio popped the smaller ones, it turned the mid-sized ones into a more liquidy state from their semi-solid sludge one. The larger ones seemed to shrug it off though. But I had another spell. I had tweaked this one as well; reducing temperature to zero worked even less than squaring it. I simply halved it instead. It did not freeze them but slowed them all considerably. We were never swamped. Julie lured in a bunch of slimes at once, we fought on multiple fronts and gained experience at an accelerated pace.

No one knew how much time went by. The sky was still dusky. We weren't hungry or thirsty, let alone sleepy. Whenever we felt a bit tired, we took time out and capped off our stamina points. Then back into the fight. Julie could now hit a slime once every 5 tries. Divin and Taro's slashes were getting slightly more precise as if they had gotten hang of the swords' weight. Carol was getting slightly better at evading jumpy slimes while kiting them. Arya had managed to find a good pace of healing, that required the least amount of rest in between. The bouncy balls did the most damage, but it was limited to small bruises. Must have been several hours at least. Some of the earlier puddles had vanished. We only noticed it because there were patches of brown grass where supposed colorful ponds were meant to be. I hadn't experimented with any more spells so far. While the fight was not exhausting physically, it was draining in an entirely different way. If we had a 'mental capacity' point, we would all be very low on it. It was in this situation that Arya suddenly exclaimed - "Guys? I just leveled up"

## Chapter 6 - Level Up

We had gathered around Arya, as she stood scrutinizing her updated Status Window. When she was done, we all looked at her expectantly.

"Well, there isn't much actually. Nothing new" she grumbled, "I just got an extra point on all my attributes. My stats have increased a bit as well. That's all."

"No new skills?" Taro asked. "None" she replied.

"What about a class upgrade? Did you get that?" I questioned. She replied in a negative. 'On second thoughts, what is a class upgrade anyway?' Apparently, Divin thought the same, as he questioned Betty about it. "So what *is* as a class upgrade and when do we get it?"

Betty's wispy form shone brightly for a split second, then she said, "Where a Level Upgrade is a quantitative change in your Class, a Class Upgrade is a qualitative one. There are 5 upgrades that you can get every 5 Level Ups starting with Novice at Level 0, Competent on Level 5, Proficient on Level 10, Expert on Level 15, finally Master on Level 20."

"So... All we get are extra points on Level Ups? And what do you mean *qualitative change*?" Julie asked.

"Yes, Level Ups affect only your attribute points. Generally, you get plus one on every attribute; however, depending on your Special Effects, it may be incremented or decremented further. While it does *look* like a numerical change, it has many subtle effects that I recommend you explore on your own. As for the Class Upgrades, they are heavily dependent on what Class and Special Effects you have in place and produce a distinct change in your Status. It would take quite a while to list all possibilities. I am sure you will understand when you undergo the same." Betty concluded.

Arya suddenly exclaimed, "She's right. Even if it's just a plus one in numbers, it changes a lot of things. I just tried casting a Heal and not only can I cast it from further away, but it also takes less mana! Now that I have more mana as well, I can go on with very short breaks, basically healing continuously!"

···

Our short interlude soon came to a head and we got back into the fight. Many of us were close to leveling up now. Half the field was clear of slimes as well! I popped a murky slime trying to trip Carol, froze another trying to latch onto Taro, and took a step back to get a broader view of the fight. Divin and Julie were doing fine on the left. Arya kept her distance, so she was safe for now. The freeze spell was handy; it cost a bit less mana at 240 and was quite effective at slowing the bouncy balls down for a while. The frozen slime eventually shivered a bit and got back to bouncing on Taro. I froze it again so Taro could get a clear shot at the core, and that's when it happened. I don't know *how* it happened. But I knew - I had leveled up. It certainly was a surprise to me, given I was behind everyone in XP at the start.

"Guys, I leveled up as well! I'm gonna go take a look at my stats", I said and retreated, after ensuring they didn't need my support. Not much I could do on low mana anyway. The others continued on their fight; I noticed Julie didn't draw any more slimes towards us.

I ran back way behind even Arya and opened my Status Window. I had hidden my attributes previously, so I made them visible again and saw what had changed.

---

| Attributes   | Points |
| --------     | ------ |
| Strength     | 2      |
| Vitality     | 2      |
| Agility      | 2      |
| Dexterity    | 3      |
| Intelligence | 10     |
| Perception   | 3      |
| Wisdom       | 3      |

---

'I see, plus one on each. Nothing more, nothing less. Not surprising, I suppose.' I thought. I hid them again and went back to my Status Window.

'Ugh, I understand my low SP. Never was high on endurance training. But only 120 HP!?! I'm pretty sure everyone else has way more than me. So XP is down to 0 again, eh? Makes sense.'

I made my way back to the scene of the fight. Divin and Julie were about to finish off a bluish head-sized slime while Carol and Taro were nipping at another. Arya was healing a wound on Carol's shoulder, at least whenever she paused from hopping about. I stood there, pensively watching the fight waiting for my stats to recover.

···

I got back in the fight again, after we all had another break to recover. I noticed that my spells were taking about 10 less mana. With the increased mana pool, I could now cast 3 successive incendios and still have some mana left. Neat!

Another few hours went by in a flash. Fight, recover, repeat. The rest of the merry band had leveled up as well. Despite that, we didn't change our strategy. It was working, and it was working *well*.

While the cheer brought by our level-ups kept our stress at bay for a bit, it could only hold for so long. I was wondering how far we would make it when Julie sighted the exit. 'Good eyes on you, Miss Archer. Wait, does she have a skill that lets her see far away or something?' I pondered as I tried to make out the exit myself.

I saw it. Another damn bridge. Well, at least this one was wider than the makeshift ledge the last one was. I was puzzled as to why it was called a Dungeon when there were no stairs going up and down anywhere.

We eventually made our way there. Not only were all of us level 1s, but some of us were also halfway to level 2 - myself included. The field was mostly clear of slimes, a few still meandering at the edges. While the ground seemed psychedelic with color nearer to us, further on, the ground was returning to its natural color. It was a brown blur back where we had started from. We gazed at the ground where we had spent however many hours fighting magical ooze of fantasy, then turned our back on the fields that granted us our first level up. Fingers crossed for many more to come!
