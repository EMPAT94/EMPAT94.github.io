Volume 1 - Tutorial

Chapter 1 - Chat Bot

I opened my eyes to a dark sky. 'Not a cloud in sight, must be late at night. Oh, no stars even in this dark, interesting...' I thought; 'Wait... Why am I looking for stars? Where the hell am I?'. There was diffused lighting about, the kind you'd get on a late sunny evening, but I couldn't pinpoint a source. My wandering hands found hold of grass beneath my prone body. Now I was worried. I quickly got up and looked about. Some sort of plain landscape surrounded by what looked to be high cliffs on all sides but one. There were some people gathered there, and that was where I made my way.

As I sauntered over to the group, I saw a figure floating in the air. I did a quick double take... 'What the hell!?!' There was a woman in Egyptian-esque costume floating about 3 meters off the ground with her eyes closed. Surrounded by 5 more people. Thankfully, the people were quite grounded - and looked as confusing as I felt. From the looks of it, they had gathered quite recently as well. Just as I was about to ask what the f*ck was going on, the floating woman opened here eyes, looked over us all as if making sure we were paying attention, then exclaimed -

"Welcome, to Grand Simulation!"

The Cleopatra look-alike continued after a slight pause, "Congratulations! You all have been chosen as test subjects for acceptance testing of Grand Simulation v389.12.425, my name is Betty, and I am here to answer any and all the questions you have. Please ask away!"

One of people standing about, a tall wiry-thin blonde woman, quickly asked "Where the f*ck am I?" - well, you took the words right out of my mouth there sister. Betty looked at the woman and answered without missing a beat,"You are currently in the Spawn Point for test subjects. The Spawn Point is located inside the Tutorial Dungeon. The Tutorial Dungeon is located in a memory space of the Simulation itself; it is however, removed from the space and time constrains of the main program!"

The blonde had her mouth hanging open. I noticed that after I managed to gather my own slack jaws. Before anyone else could ask anything else, I spoke up - "How do we get back home?". Betty's eyes, which were trained on the blonde so far, now bore into me. They seemed devoid of life for some reason. She spoke in her eerie voice again "To get out of the Tutorial, and the Simulation as whole, you must be deleted; in other word, you must die." Not only did our mouths hang open like a sink hole, I felt several heart beats skip, mine included. We all looked at each other, but no one spoke for a while.

"Anoo... How are you flying?" a black haired youth on my left asked. He had been gawking at Betty for a while. 'Quite the silver-lining kind of guy we have here; also she is not flying, just floating'. Betty turned to him in her mechanical manner; I was glad she wasn't staring at me anymore, and answered "It is a spell that inverses gravity until the mass of my body is balanced off by the pull in either direction at height of 2.73 meters off ground line". While that was a lot to chew on, I immediately caught on something - 'float SPELL!?!'. Apparently the silver-lining kid did as well - he was practically shaking with excitement. "_You can do magic?_" he asked her. She replied again; perhaps it was only me, but it looked like she was expecting this question, "Why yes! Everyone in the Simulation can cask spells and do magic. Even you! Some classes are restricted to only using said spells while other classes can actively tweak other spells or create new ones entirely!". 'Classes? Magic?' what...

 "Ummm... Is there any other way of getting out of this... Simulation. Besides, you know, dying?" a fair doe-eyed girl asked from beside the blonde. "No", Betty replied, and continued eyeing the poor girl as if mocking her. While everyone digested that, I put in another question, "What are we supposed to do here?". To which Betty replied after setting her glare on me, "First, you must complete the Tutorial to get to the base level of adults in the Simulation; once you finish the Tutorial and enter the Simulation, you are free to do as you wish".

 Betty wasn't going anywhere soon. The blonde had confirmed that with her. So here we were, introducing ourselves. Again, the blonde took charge and went first -

 "You all can call me Julie. I'm a lawyer, and I live in Berlin" she said, and looking around for who was going next. Another plump looking girl with a reddish hair-do by her side coughed slightly to get everyone's attention.

 I suddenly noticed that there were three women, all on my right, grouped up. An two guys standing some distance apart to my left. The Japanese kid and another slightly overweight guy. Everyone was either around my age or younger than me. The girl continued her introduction since no one interrupted -

 "I'm Carol, from Ireland. I am studying Uni". With that, she did a slight bow of her head and stepped back. If not for the current situations, I could see her being the life of a party, or being mischievous in general. No one spoke up next, so I did.

 "Name's Pat, I'm a Programmer". I said my piece and stayed silent. No point in wasting too much words. The Japanese guy went next.

 "Hajimemashta, my name is Taro. I am 17 years old, a high school student from Japan" he said and looked around with a carefree smile. What I'd give to know where his cheery attitude came from!

 "Divin's the name, I am from Congo. I own a small business" said the other guy. The only remaining girl had the attention of us all; she didn't seem too keen on talking but said nonetheless -

 "I am Arya" she said simply. 'To the point, are we?'
