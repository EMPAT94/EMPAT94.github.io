# Volume 1 - Tutorial

## Prologue

I opened my eyes to a dark sky. 'Not a cloud in sight, must be late at night. Oh, no stars even in this dark, interesting...' I thought; 'Wait... Why am I looking for stars? Where the hell am I?'. There was diffused lighting about, the kind you'd get on a late sunny evening, but I couldn't pinpoint a source. My wandering hands found hold of grass beneath my prone body. Now I was worried. I quickly got up and looked about. Some sort of plain landscape surrounded by what looked to be high cliffs on all sides but one. There were some people gathered there, and that was where I made my way.

As I sauntered over to the group, I saw a figure floating in the air. I did a quick double take... 'What the hell!?!' There was a woman in Egyptian-esque costume floating about 3 meters off the ground with her eyes closed. Surrounded by 5 more people. Thankfully, the people were quite grounded - and looked as confusing as I felt. From the looks of it, they had gathered quite recently as well. Just as I was about to ask what the f*ck was going on, the floating woman opened here eyes, looked over us all as if making sure we were paying attention, then exclaimed -

"Welcome, to the Grand Simulation!"

The Cleopatra look-alike continued after a slight pause, "Congratulations! You all have been chosen as test subjects for acceptance testing of Grand Simulation v389.12.425. My name is Betty, and I am here to answer any and all the questions you have. Please ask away!"

One of people standing about, a tall wiry-thin blonde woman, quickly asked "Where the f*ck am I?" - well, you took the words right out of my mouth there sister. Betty looked at the woman and answered without missing a beat, "You are currently in the Spawn Point for test subjects. The Spawn Point is located inside the Tutorial Dungeon. The Tutorial Dungeon is located in the memory space of the Simulation itself; it is however, removed from the space and time constrains of the main program!"

The blonde had her mouth hanging open. I noticed that, after I managed to gather my own slack jaws. Before anyone else could ask anything else, I spoke up - "How do we get back home?". Betty's eyes, which were trained on the blonde so far, now bore into me. They seemed devoid of life for some reason. She spoke in her eerie voice again "To get out of the Tutorial, and the Simulation as whole, you must be deleted; in other word, you must die." Not only did our mouths hang open again like a sink hole, I felt several heart skip a beat, or perhaps just mine skipping more than once. We all looked at each other, but no one spoke for a while.

"Anoo... How are you flying?" a black haired youth on my left asked. He had been gawking at Betty for a while. 'Quite the silver-lining kind of guy we have here; also she is not flying, just floating' I argued in my mind. Betty turned to him in her mechanical manner - I was glad she wasn't staring at me anymore, and answered "It is a spell that inverses gravity until the mass of my body is balanced off by the pull in either direction at an elevation of 2.73 meters off the ground". While that was a lot to chew on, I immediately caught on something - 'float SPELL?'. Apparently the silver-lining kid did as well - he was practically shaking with excitement. "*You can do magic?*" he asked her. She replied again - perhaps it was only me, but it looked like she was expecting this question, "Why yes! Everyone in the Simulation can cast spells and do magic. Even you! Some classes are restricted to only using said spells while other classes can actively tweak other spells or create new ones entirely!". 'Classes? Magic? What...?'

"Ummm... Is there any other way of getting out of this... Simulation. Besides, you know, dying?" a fair doe-eyed girl asked from beside the blonde. "I'm afraid there isn't", Betty replied, and continued eyeing the poor girl as if mocking her. While everyone digested that, I put in another question, "What are we supposed to do here?". To which Betty replied after setting her glare on me, "First, you must complete the Tutorial to get to the base level of adults in the Simulation; once you finish the Tutorial and enter the Simulation, you are free to do as you wish".

---

Betty wasn't going anywhere soon; the blonde had confirmed that with her. So here we were, introducing ourselves at blondie's insistence; she went first -

"You all can call me Julie. I'm a lawyer, and I live in Berlin" she said, and looking around for who was going next. Another plump looking girl with a reddish hair-do by her side coughed slightly to get everyone's attention.

I suddenly noticed that there were three women, all on my right, grouped up. And two guys standing some distance apart to my left. The Japanese kid and another slightly overweight guy. Everyone was either around my age or younger than me. The girl continued her introduction since no one interrupted -

"I'm Carol, Irish. I am studying Uni". With that, she did a slight nod of her head and stepped back. If not for the current situations, I could see her being the life of a party, or being mischievous in general. No one spoke up next, so I did.

"Name's Pat, I'm a Programmer". I said my piece and stayed silent. No point in wasting too much words. The Japanese guy went next.

"Hajimemashta, my name is Taro. I am 17 years old, a high school student from Japan" he said and looked around with a carefree smile, as if he knew some secret no one else did. What I'd give to know where his cheery attitude came from!

"Divin's the name, I am from Congo. I own a small business" said the guy in a deep voice. The only remaining girl had the attention of us all; she didn't seem too keen on talking but spoke nonetheless -

"I am Arya" she said simply. 'To the point, are we?'

'Good, now that's done, back to getting the hell out of doge' I thought. Apparently, so did everyone else, as we all turned back to Betty for an in-depth interrogation session. 'Please let this just be some weird dream' I prayed. If only I knew the kind of sh*t I was going to end up in, I might have prayed harder, a lot harder...

## Chapter 1 - Chat Bot

"Why are we here?" (Julie)

"You all are test subjects for -" (Betty)

"No, I mean, why are *WE* here? Why us?" (Julie)

"Oh, you were randomly sampled from your planet with uniform distribution of gender and location. Also, your ability to speak, read and write the common language fluently favored your selection to a certain degree" (Betty)

"..."

"Can't you just send us back?" (Carol, looking a bit hopeful)

"I'm afraid I cannot send you back" (Betty)

"How do I do magic?" (Taro, still excited)

"First, you must select a Class. There are 6 base Classes that anyone can chose from, although you may chose only one; all Classes have the ability to cast magic. However, only Healer and Mage Classes can create spells on their own. Other Classes rely on their Skills to intuitively cast magic." (Betty)

"Sweet, how do I get a Class?"  (Taro)

"To get a - " (Betty)

"Wait, hold on. What the hell is this? Just how are we here? Am I dreaming or something? Why can't you send us back home? You basically kidnapped us and are now forcing us to do whatever. Well, I don't care. I wanna go home" (Me, slightly losing it)

"This is the Tutorial Dungeon. You are not dreaming. You can leave the Simulation by deleting yourself." (Betty)

"OK, so how did you bring us here? I don't remember being nabbed or anything." (Me)

"I did not bring you here, I am here just to answer your questions" (Betty)

"So... *How* exactly did we end up here?" (Arya, out of nowhere)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Why not?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"Yeah I know, you just said that. I'm asking why not?" (Me, exasperated)

"I'm afraid I cannot answer that question" (Betty)

"..."

"She's a dammed chat bot! Just great! Stuck inside a simulation with a bunch of strangers and a smart-ass bot." (Me, mostly to myself but came out loud)

"You're a chat bot, aren't you?" (Me)

"I'm afraid I cannot - " (Betty)

"Of course you cannot..." (Me, grumbling to myself again)

"Ano... How do I get a Class again?" (Taro, looking at me as if asking me to shut up)

"To get a Class, you must open up your Status Window. You can open your Status Window by swiping up with a finger. Before you select a Class, I recommend going through the descriptions to get one most suited to yourself, as you will be stuck with that Class and its evolution tree for the rest of Simulation" (Betty)

Everyone flipped their finger in the air and got a glazed look in their eyes. I flipped my finger as well, and a virtual reality type window opened up. It was empty save for two things - a "Select Class" read glowing text and a tiny tilde ~ symbol at the bottom right. I was about to click on "Select Class" when I heard Divin, who had been silent so far, speak up.

"Why are you dressed like that?" (Divin, deadpanned)

"This Simulation and everything in it has been constructed with inspiration taken from your planet's stories from the ages, be they history or fantasy." (Betty)

"Is that so..." (Divin, quieting down)

Now dragged out of our concentration from admiring the Status Windows, another barrage of questions was fired at Betty.

"What about our necessities? Like food, water etc?" (Julie)

"You do not need sustenance in the Tutorial Dungeon. This place is outside of the main program and not subject to the same space and time constrains; as such you are exempt from hunger, thirst and sleep for the duration of your stay. You will however, get injured or fatigued as you expend health or stamina, and will require treatment or a period of rest  respectively to reclaim it." (Betty)

"So we just... Finish this tutorial and get out of here? All on our own?" (Arya)

"The aim of this Tutorial is to bring you to the baseline of an adult human in the Simulation. You may act alone, or in groups. I will, however, follow along until you have completed the Tutorial Dungeon to answer any and all questions you have. Please ask away!" (Betty)

No one asked anything. Apparently, Betty was going to stick around, or rather float around, for quite a while. We all went back to our Status Windows to read the Class Descriptions.

## Chapter 2 - Class Selection

I clicked on Select Class text. Nothing happened. My hand went through the window. I looked at the interface for a while. I tried clicking the tilde symbol. Same nothing. I looked about and saw others going through similar ordeals. Eventually, Taro whined impatiently at Betty "Nothing is happening, my finger goes through it! How do I click on this?" Betty immediately answered, "Physical interaction with the Status Window was phased out 254 major versions ago, to 'click' on an item, simply focus on same. While a bit unwieldy at first, stats show that such interaction is 28 times more efficient than previous medium."

I focused on the text, and immediately the screen was replaced by a bunch of sections - six, to be precise. I slowly scrolled through each section, reading the brief description of each.

---

KNIGHT - Base Class

Sword wielding swashbuckler, adept at mêlée combat; very high stamina and strength attributes with the ability to use quick skills in addition to sword, and keep up a good defence at the same time.

SCOUT - Base Class

Highly agile and stealthy, they generally prepare for the arrival of main party - be it by securing the route ahead or scoping out the enemy camp for potential incursion points.

HEALER - Base Class

With a good leg up on intelligence and stamina attributes, healers take care of their health - and that of others, by topping it off with pre-defined skills or customized spells.

CRAFTSMAN - Base Class

Low but well-rounded attributes, get an extra utility skill on each level up. Create or modify items, enchantments and structures right up from raw materials.

ARCHER - Base Class

Focusing on dexterity and agility, this long ranger either distracts an opponent so the party can get close or goes in for the killer shot on a distracted one, adapting to the situation as required.

MAGE - Base Class

Very high intelligence at the cost of other attributes, mages are to magic what craftsmen are to materials. Instead of getting a pre-defined skill when leveling up, they craft their own highly specialized and equally deadly spells, be they against one or a hundred opponents.

---

Ha... My Class was set a while ago when Betty described them for the first time. I focused on selecting that class and the window went back to the main screen describing my Class and current Status

I was feeling quite good about myself. I looked around to see that others were still absorbed in their screens. I waited a minute, then another. After 5 min, I was quite sure something was amiss. I asked Betty about the tutorial to while away time. According to her, there were 25 levels going down until the 'Exit Protal' at the bottom. We were currently on level 0. You couldn't enter a higher level unless you matched that level. She mentioned that the tutorial was tailored to get us to level 25, which was apparently the baseline of adult humans in this (well, outer) world. She wouldn't go in depth about the environment of each level and other details, so I figured it was more 'explore-and-see' kind of thing the creators were going for. She wouldn't answer who the creators where, what or who the test was for, or absolutely anything that had nothing to do with the Simulation. I tried several different variations but she her lips were sealed tight.

This back and forth went on for another 15 minutes I reckon, when people started coming to. I looked around to hear what each had chosen. Hopefully, not everyone had chosen the Mage class.

---

"Man, the Mage class is so nerfed! And here I was, foolishly looking forward to it." Taro exclaimed. 'Wait... What?'

"Yeah", Carol agreed, "when I looked at the detailed description and attribute distribution, it was even below the Craftsman class. Anyway, I chose the Scout. What about you two?" 'Heh?'

"I chose Knight" he said - as if it should have been obvious, and looked at me expectantly.

"Ummm, what do you mean when you say the Mage class is nerfed? And what's this about attribute distribution?" I asked them instead. To which Taro replied, "Well, if you focused on getting detailed info about a certain Class, you could see in-depth information about their capabilities, roles and growth potentials. I say Mage is nerfed because that class does not get any skills like other classes do. They have to create spells on their own to use magic. Why would anyone want to do research here?", with a pause, he continued, "Also, all the attributes were lowest I could see compared to others - even craftsmen had a good 3 on most, except for very high intelligence. What's the point of starting off with lots of mana when you can't even use it, right? And I don't even know how one would go about building customized spells - sounds like a lot of work to me." Taro concluded. All I could think of was - 'Well... sh*t'

Carol chimed in, "Yeah, I even got 3 special effects for my class. I believe Mage had only one. How many did you get for the Knight, Taro...". The conversation continued; eventually, the rest of the girls joined in. Arya took the Healer class, Julie the Archer. Finally, Divin joined in too. Apparently, he had taken the Kinght class as well. There was a bit of hubbub over there not being any Craftsman, but I was too engaged in cursing my own stupidity and impatience to notice much of what was being said at the moment.

---

After a while, I told them that I had taken the Mage class. Thankfully, all I got were a few confused looks. It seems that the attributes were also depended on class. As such, the Knight class had a 'Vigor' attribute that regulated HP regeneration, while the Scout had 'Stealth' attribute - I had neither. Arya apparently had an 'Attunement' that affected the rate of healing applied to others. I realised I had no clue what effects attributes had, so I excused myself and took another look at the Status Window, this time willing it to show me attribute description.

---

| Attribute    | Affects |
| ------------ | ------ |
| STRENGTH     | Physical attack damage dealt and received |
| VITALITY     | Health Points |
| AGILITY      | Movement Speed |
| DEXTERITY    | Movement Range |
| INTELLIGENCE | Mana Points |
| PERCEPTION   | Magical attack range |
| WISDOM       | Magical attack defence |

---

I see. I have no special health regeneration; and every monster and their mother would notice me without the stealth attribute. Others also had a 'skills' section below special effects with one skill each already. While I was reading the attribute description, Carol was trying out a skill to silent her footsteps. With magic. And here I was - a Mage, twiddling my thumbs. Yeah, I was pretty pissed off at myself.

## Chapter 3 - Level 0

Dream is only a dream, after you wake up. While you are dreaming, it becomes your reality. I believe all of us here had taken being kidnapped quite well, considering everything. At least no one broke down. I could tell Carol was putting up a brave front. Taro was actively enjoying it. Julie was still on the fence about whether to laugh or cry, but she was distracting herself by taking control of things. Arya was silently sulking. I couldn't get a read on Divin though. As for me? I was wondering what my folks at home would be up to, they must've lost it by now. I decided to ask the Betty about it, not expecting an answer, "Hey, what about the people back on our planet, surely they would've noticed us missing?" Surprisingly, I got a response. "The Simulation is not subject to the space-time constrains of your world; just like the Tutorial is separate from the Simulation, the Simulation is separate from your reality." 'Ah, makes sense. It is like time has stopped there, eh?'

We gathered around Betty, ready to go where fate would lead us. Julie was just about to say something when Betty spoke up again - "So, you have all got your Classes, allow me to lend your starting equipment!" So saying, she raised her hand and down came a stream of light in front of each of us. Two swords in front of Taro and Divin, a bow and quiver full of arrows in front of Julie, a dagger for Carol and staff for Arya. I got nothing. "Ummm, my equipment seems to be missing?" I queried. "Mages don't need a physical weapon to attack", she said. 'What, are you kidding me?'. "At least, give me a dagger or something, just in case!" I begged. "I'm afraid I cannot". I looked around and got only sympathetic looks. I didn't give up though, "But I do not know any magic spells. How am I supposed to defend myself?". "Novice Mages have one free slot in which they can utilize their customized spell, I'd recommend creating one" she said. "I didn't really go to Hogwards, you know. I have absolutely no clue how to go about making or using a spell!" I bit back. "While I do not have the data of how you should create your spell, I am certain you must use your Status Window to create one. For reference, allow me to upload my floating spell into your repository..."

I opened up my Status Window again and immediately noticed that the tilde (~) symbol at the bottom was bold. I focused on it and a terminal like screen opened up. It was blank save for one line:

`float self = while (self.elevation < 2.73) *****.gravity--`

I was dumbstruck. 'Sh*t...It's a god damned program. True, it looks like an unholy union of Haskell and Javascript, with bits of redacted code; but I recognize it nonetheless. And I actually have a shell to work on? F*cking A!' I almost did a small victory celebration but contained myself hastily. My smile did betray me however, as Arya had a weird look in her eyes as if there was something on my face.

"Perhaps we should get going now?" Julie broke the awkward silence and looked at Betty. Betty didn't move a muscle. Seems like she meant it literally when she said she will be *following* us, not *guiding* us. Another moment later, Julie huffed a bit, shouldering her bow and arrows, and lead the way out of the Spawn Point clearing. Just as we stepped out of the choke point leading out onto a wide road, Betty turned from Cleopatra to Will-'O-the-Wisp. It was Carol who spoke up, "Why'd ya turn into a ball of light?" to wish Betty replied, "It is easier to split into multiple entities in this form, and it is also lighter on resource consumption" 'Ah, she did say she would follow us all even after we went individually. So this is how. Weird, but logical.' Apparently, Carol thought so too, because she didn't have any follow-up questions.

---

The unremarkable road eventually lead us to an unremarkable field. It was big enough to fill couple of football stadiums. Albeit barren of any fauna, it was sprouting something oozy in large quantities. Wait, are these slimes? "What is this, what _are_ those?" Julie enquired, motioning in the general direction of the slimes. Betty the wisp spoke up, "This is Level 0 of the Tutorial Dungeon - The Slime Field" 'Clever naming sense there' "The entrance to Level 1 is on the opposite side of our current position; you must cross this field and reach level 1 before you can proceed further"
