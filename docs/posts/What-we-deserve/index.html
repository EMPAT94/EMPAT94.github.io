  <h1>What we deserve</h1>

  <p>There I was trying to catch a wink - that seemed to have vanished as soon as I hit the bed, when as usual the brain started throwing up unfathomable imaginary sceneries. I have learnt the hard way the vainness of trying to stop this - the more you try, the harder it drives; instead, I tried to steer the process towards more &quot;down-to-earth&quot; issues.</p>
<p>I have been coveting a certain position for myself this past month or so. This desire was where I tuned my brain towards and soon enough I was up to my neck in thoughts of &quot;what-ifs&quot;, you know how it goes. The important point here is that I was at this fork where I was wondering what would be the best course of action if I lost to a derelict fate the desired status quo of my future. To keep working at it or Be content with what I have.</p>
<p>Yes, this world is very polarizing. We come across experiences that enables us to form our opinions. And as such, each person usually has different opinions and perspectives on a matter. In my case, it was the Star Wars series. Like any impressionable young guy out there, after watching them movies, I took it in my heart to be like a Jedi. More importantly, there was this specific assertment that I was in awe of and found sagity inside - &quot;If you're afraid to lose something, let it go&quot;. Now, I admit I've never actually applied this in practice, but still it lingered in the recesses of my mind and &quot;poured forth&quot; when I was stuck upon this fork. But it wasn't the only thing that came forth - it's never so simple, is it?</p>
<p>Relying on technology to connect with age old quirky friend, I put forth my predicament. She was of the opinion that &quot;Never Giving Up&quot; is the only way through - ALWAYS. I was a bit skeptical about this, so I presented a couple of scenarios where-in that approach would result in disastrous consequences. She countered with her own hypothesis - i realized that, she was applying her own approach of Never Giving Up on me in this discussion itself. Although it didn't leave me thoroughly convinced, it did leave a mark where I thought this approach could work in certain situations. So yeah, this thought too poured in, along with the aforementioned.</p>
<p>When I voiced my concerns to my room-mate, he had some opinions of his own. He said, and I quote &quot;We get what we deserve&quot;. I was astounded - who decides what we deserve? He retorted that our actions determine that, to which I said, in not so polite words, &quot;My dear friend, my actions are the exact thing we are trying to plan here&quot; He kept his stand on the &quot;deserving&quot; thing, which I thought could have some shred of viability to it; but NOT in the way he proposed. It seemed too primitive, too easy a way out. After considerable discussions, enough to drive his sleep away too, we came to an agreement on a theory that I believe provides a not-so-easy-but-probably-right way out.</p>
<p>Know these terms - &quot;Pre-deserve&quot;, &quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;Post-deserve&quot;. Here I put forth the theory in these terms that seemed to make sense to my sleep-deprived brain.</p>
<p>At the initial stage, based on your talent and actions hitherto, you have a pre-disposition to achieve your &quot;Pre-deserve&quot; state. For example, if you're good at table tennis, better than anyone in your class then you pre-deserve to be on the team before anyone else from your class is considered. But does it mean you deserve to play in the State-level clashes? I think not. This is where the &quot;Accept&quot; part comes in, which you either do or you don't. If you follow my old friend's philosophy of &quot;never giving up&quot;, and continue to take actions in honing your talent, then at some point, you will definitely deserve to be in the State-level matches. This state is &quot;Post-deserve&quot; state. Now the question is, at what point do you just &quot;Accept&quot; instead of &quot;Never Giving Up&quot;. That, my friend, is quite simple. When you're happy, &quot;accept&quot; it. Now, there is considerable difference between being content and being happy - but this post isn't about that; It is about an approach to face conundrums, and I guess I've just given you the master key.</p>
<p>As I presented this to my room-mate with same flourish as I do to you now, he snorted and said &quot;Can I sleep now?&quot; I guess when some people just don't see the lock, what's the point of showing them a key? I plan to enlighten the old friend I mentioned before, yet I fear she's too into the &quot;never giving up&quot; approach to ever give up convincing me otherwise. It may not late for her still, as I hope it isn't for you too.</p>
<p>See, there is no one process which can solve all your problems. It's usually an intermix of this and that, which is what I've tried to do and - ironically - create one cohesive process that can solve all problems. Yet, I'll reiterate, I have yet to fully apply this in person. I did reach the &quot;post-deserved&quot; state and achieve the goal I coveted, but this circular has re-initiated. I haven't yet &quot;accepted&quot; and probably won't for a long time to come. But when I do, I hope I'll be Happy. I will then close the issue and rightly consider this theory to go down as a Universal Law. Well, a guy can dream. Anyway, I hope you gleaned some such from my rattlings, or if you're someone like my room-mate who after encountering such a philosophy tends to snore (in his defense, he does so only when he's sleepy), I'm glad I was instrumental in helping you catch that ever-so-elusive wink. Cheerio.</p>
