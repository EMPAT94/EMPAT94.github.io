<h1>My story</h1>

<h2>Once upon a time, in a land not so far away...</h2>

<p>
  Christened "Pritesh" by the family, I grew up in a small town during the formative years of my life devoted to video
  games - my "first" love. I have been gaming for as far back as I can remember. On my mother's insistence, I got a
  library card - and fell in love a second time. This time with words. Well, it was more pictures than words initially
  (looking at you Phantom &amp; Mandrake), but before long I was gobbling up Jeffrey Archer's and Dan Brown's works.
  Finally, my friends took me to a new swimming pool club that had recently opened where I formed my final love of
  childhood days - swimming.
</p>

<h2>In the midst of it all</h2>
<p>
  I moved to the city for higher studies. Here, I got my first taste of things that would define my life for coming
  decade - Anime, Light Novels, and Programming! (Of course, excluding the usual "firsts" of college days.) Wile the
  former two were quite understandable, I won't lie about programming - I was hella flummuxed by it first. Only at first
  though. As I learned more about the workings of it all, I was quickly attached to the concept. The process of
  understanding a problem - dissecting it just so, then wrestling to fit it into the current language's paradigm,
  finally getting it to run without errors. And boy oh boy, when works just the way you wanted it to? I STILL feel that
  exhilration of a smoothly executed code run just as much as I did back when I printed my first "Hello World"!
</p>

<h2>Here we are now</h2>

<p>
  Skip to after college. Got a job at TCS though a hackathon. Later on, I joined a startup, where I currently work - HPS
  Lab Designs. I started off as a back-end Nodejs developer, eventually moving on to front-end React development as
  well. Recently, I found my way into React-Native platfrom. I usually describe my work as a Full Stack Web and Mobile
  App Development, which succintly covers the core of it. This year (2021), I shall successfully complete 4 years in the
  industry, hoping for many more wonderful years to come!
</p>

<h2>The future?</h2>

<p>World domination? Haha just kidding. I shall mark this place [reserved]. Cheers!</p>
