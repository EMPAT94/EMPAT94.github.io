    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>I am Pritesh A. Tupe, a programmer by craft - currently living in Mumbai, India. Some might also describe me as a hobbyist writer or a budding violinist.</p>

    <p>Got my first taste of programming when I was ~ 8 years old and had to move a turtle about to form a square - not that i really knew what programming was back then.</p>

    <p>I truly reconnected with programming when I started programming in C and Java for my college course - 12 years later. This time though, I did have a faint clue about computers and code. <i>Note that I mean 'programming' and not 'computers' - I have been playing video games since I was 3 years old!</i></p>

    <p>I currently work at HPS Lab Designs as a Full Stack Dev majorly focused on MERN Stack whilst dabbling in React-Native, having accumulated about 3 years of experience in the industry.</p>

    <p>Besides aforementioned activities, I also love to swim, read (fiction mostly), and yeah...game ;)</p>

    <h2>Why do I blog?</h2>

    <p>I love to write about stuff... always have. Once, a friend suggested "why not share it on a blog or something?". So I did. Initially on blogger, now on this site.</p>

    <p>I plan to write about my journey through life and the stuff I learn - both as a professional and as a human. It might be of use to someone somewhere, it might not. At the very least, it helps me "scratch that itch".</p>

    <p>If you like (or dislike) something on this site and want to let me know, or just wanna say hi, make sure to contact me. Looking forward to hearing from you, cheers!</p>
